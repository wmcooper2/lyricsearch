Pronounced as kind 
F-U-C-K 
Is that how you spell friend in your dictionary 
Black on black 
A guidebook for the blind 

Well now that I can see my eyes won't weep 
Now that I can hear your song sounds cheap 
Now that I can talk all your corn I'll reap 
I'm not so sure that Joey wed a Virgin Mary

Is that how you spelled me in your dictionary 
Four-eyed fool 
You led 'round everywhere 

Now that I can see it's the queens new clothes 
Now that I can hear all your poison prose 
Now that I can talk with my tongue unfroze
I'm not so sure of Santa or the buck-tooth fairy 
There are no words for me inside your dictionary

But the hollow ring has no finger in 
So let's close the book and let the day begin 
And our marriage be undone
