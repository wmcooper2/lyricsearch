Oh, oh yeah
Oh ow
It was midnight 
At the party
As you walked in
Lookin' nice
You had Versace
All over your body
And your thong
With no panty line

And that's
When you started
Shakin' your hips
Lickin' your lips
Using your eyes
Rollin' your thighs

All of the things
That turn me on

You know I was 
Kinda checkin' you out
There was no doubt
You were about
Checkin' me out

There's no need to
Come on so strong

[Chorus: x2]
You're finding me
Way too tight but you
Gotta be shakin' that thing
Like you a part of me
You don't gotta
Be that way to
Ride wit me
If you could
Save all that 

Now that
We are moving
And you're lookin' 
Kinda wild
With your body
In position
And then lean in
Doggy style

Right then
I knew for me
It was on
It wouldn't be long
Till we were gone
That's what I want

You could have had me
Without all that play

Right then I thought of
Takin' you home
But leave you alone
Cause you weren't about
Makin' it out

There's no way to
Fine act that way

[Chorus]

What could ever make you
Think you had the dough 
To throw yourself at me?
The way you look baby
You could have anyone
Why can't you see?
