My temperature's rising, my fingers are tingling
They're starting to shake
I look in the mirror and everything's funny
I think you're a fake
And why did I do it, how could I say that
I wanna come down?
Everything's swirling and I just forgot
Why I came to this town

So now I think I'm all tied up
So now I think I'm tangled up
I know and I can't see no more
I know and I can't see no more

My temperature's rising, my fingers are tingling

I think I'm a fake
And why did I do it, how could I say that

Everything's swirling and I just forgot
Why I came to this town
