Life can be so hard 
And have you feeling odd? 
Time can be so long 
And life can be abound 

Think it over girl 
I'll be waiting 
You'll have all the world 
Just be patient 

They might break your heart 
But girl, I know, that you're smart 
You'll find new men 
And new love 

And back that fresh new start 

Think it over girl 
I'll be waiting 
You'll have all the world 
Just be patient 

Right there deep in your heart 
Is the key to everything 
Take your time to find out 
What your heart holds deep within 
'Cause it will be a present 
And the reason why I sing 

It'll be a present 
And there are answers deep within 
Think it over girl 
I'll be waiting 
You'll have all the world 
Just be patient 

I'll be waiting 
I'll be waiting 
Always be waiting 
Girl
