You gonna wish it never did

Hey, baby, sexy lady
You make them pants look crazy
I know you schemin', have you leavin'
Screamin', "Fuck you, pay me"

L.A. got tons of dameies
That's quick to have that baby
And that try to squeeze you
For every penny that you thought of makin'

These streets is fuckin' viscious
Can't make the wrong decisions
They have you shot up
And shot up, caught up behind some bitches

Handle your business homie
'Cause ain't no homies in business
So many people in this business
Be so fuckin' phony

I see right through them traps
These niggaz run their yaps
But when it really cracked
Them pussy niggaz runnin' laps

I clap 'em in they tracks
My paper come in stacks
And stacks of rubberbands
Thicker than a paperback

Just let the henny flow
Go where you wanna go
My party heavyset
Ready set, baby, here we go

Its not a fuckin' game
You know my fuckin' name
I'm number one
With a motherfuckin' bullet man

You know it could happen
It don't happen till it happen
When it happen
You gonna wish it never did
Mouthafucka

You know it could happen
It don't happen till it happen

My soldiers go with missiles
Gauges, grenades, and pistols
Picture on the front of the paper
Dyin' to press the issue

My soldiers gettin' at you
Full clip is spittin' at you
You duck and stuck in position
Just like a fuckin' statue

Nigga I'm quarterbackin'
We got it fully crackin' and poppin'
And showin' no signs
Of stopin' with options

Fuck the industry
Derive energy from hennessey
Literally, I smoke like a chimney

Y'all know we got them hummers tight
We got them lovers right
They want to catch ya
Get naked begin to spend the night

Here you go some good advice
Come through steppin' light
Believe me, extremely easy
To lose your life

Get 'em up and keep 'em up
They tryin' to get me touched
If you gonna swing it nigga
Bring it I don't give a fuck!

Better make this party jump
Better make this club bounce
So take your shoes
Before you step your ass in my house

You know it could happen
It don't happen till it happen
When it happen
You gonna wish it never did
Muthafucka

You know it could happen
It don't happen till it happen
When it happen
You gonna wish it never did

Bitch, we keep it crackin' right
We bring it back to life
Biohazard motherfuckas
That spreadin' like a parasite

We ain't the fuckin' type
You get the target site
Lee Boyd Malvo
Can't stop me now, no

Get your fuckin' paper up
We outta snatch it up
Full metal jacket
Stay clap clapped in the back 'em up

Don't even think about it
You get your shit rerouted
Straw for your food
Have you pissin' through a plastic tube

I know you fuckin' hate it
We stay inebriated
Break out the hennsy bottle
Baby your regulated

It's not a fuckin' game
You know my fuckin' name
I'm number one
With a motherfuckin' bullet man

You know it could happen
It don't happen till it happen
When it happen
You gonna wish it never did
Muthafucka

You know it could happen
It don't happen till it happen
When it happen
You gonna wish it never did
