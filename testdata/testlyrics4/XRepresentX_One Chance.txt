Never thought it'd be so easy 
to turn your back and walk away. 
Something that held such meaning 
has disappeared because you came of age. 

Now you could never take it back. 
You only get one chance, one time. 
Now you could never take it back. 
It means fucking nothing, unless it's for fucking life. 

You'd always preach to everyone 
who didn't quite think the same. 
But now it's no fucking surprise 
that you gone and thrown it all away. 

Now you could never take it back. 
You only get one chance, one time. 
Now you could never take it back. 
It means fucking nothing, unless it's for fucking life. 

One chance, one time, one chance. 
It means nothing unless it's for fucking life
