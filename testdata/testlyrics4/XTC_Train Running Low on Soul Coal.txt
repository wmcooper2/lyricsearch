Me train running low on soul coal 
They push and pull tactics are driving me loco 
They shouldn't do that no no no 
They shouldn't do that 

Me train running low on dream steam 
They pull me whistle too hard me bound to scream 
And they shouldn't do that no no no 
They shouldn't do that 

Think I'm going south for the winter 
Think I'm going mad in this hinterland 
Between young and old 
I'm a thirty year old puppy doing what I'm told 
And I'm told there's no more coal 
For the older engines 
Me train running low on soul coal 

Think I'm going south for the winter 
Think I'm going west and my sprinter's speed 
Is reduced to a crawl 
My rails went straight, but straight into the wall 
It's the wall on which they dash the older engines 

And all my servants are leaving 
Imagination gone packing 
Can't find the wound from where I'm bleeding 
He's just a nut and he's cracking 

Hammer goes down 
Brakes all scream 
Me and a couple of empty carriages 
Slide down hill still 
Next stop bad dreamsville 

Think I'm going south for the winter 
Me train running low on soul coal.
