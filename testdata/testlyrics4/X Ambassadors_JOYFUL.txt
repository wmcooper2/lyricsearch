Doctors' notes, swinging votes, but I can't decide
If I stay here much longer, surely will die
Lived the life full of vice wwith passion and crime
Can't say I'm perfect, but I certainly tried

To be joyful, joyful
Joyful and happy, sunny and bright
To be joyful, joyful
Joyful and happy, just being alive

No one left, no one except my demons and I
No one to forgive me, I'm running out of time
And it's up to me to try and meet my fate with a smile
And it might sound silly, but I still will try

To be joyful, joyful
Joyful and happy, sunny and bright
To be joyful, joyful
Joyful and happy, just being alive

Joyful, joyful
Oooh, oooh

To be joyful, joyful, joyful, joyful
Oooh, oooh, (oh yeah)
Joyful (joyfull to enjoy), joyful, (I have found my joy)
Joyful and happy, sunny and bright
