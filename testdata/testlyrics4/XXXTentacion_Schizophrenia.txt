Voices in your, voices in your, voices in your head
Those who tryna drive you mad
And make it all, make it all 
Wild!

There's another mind deep in me
Don't know what's gotten into me
I ain't seen the other side plentifully
'Til the end I'll, 'til the end I'll fight
There's another mind deep in me
Don't know what's gotten into me
I ain't seen the other side plentifully
'Til the end I'll, 'til the end I'll fight

Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
Don't give up, don't give up!
