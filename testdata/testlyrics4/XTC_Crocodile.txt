Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
That she left me for him 

Scene one standing 
Crushed on landing 
You may have walked out 
But I'll swallow up my fate 

Scene two sitting 
Man in kitchen 
Bit cold and lifeless like 
The burger on my plate 

But there's one emotion I'm afraid of 
Hear him scratching gently to be fed 
I can't stand it when he sits there smiling 
I don't want him nesting in my head 

Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
That she left me for him 
So get away 
Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
I'm not letting you in 

Scene three lying (through his back teeth) 
Speared and dying (bitten beneath) 
I'll crawl the wall to hand there 
Skinned and stuffed with drink 

But there's one emotion I'm controlling 
Green eyed monster with his jaws spread wide 
(But he's your pet now, you can't run away and hide) 
I can't stand it when he sits there crying 
I don't want to throw myself inside 

Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
That she left me for him 
Get away 
Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
I'm not letting you in 
So get away, oh

Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
That she left me for him 
So get away 
Crocodile 
No you won't make me jealous 
I'm not letting you in 

Oh get away
Get away, from me
Get away, hey hey
Get, get away
Get, get away from me you crocodile
Get, get, get, get, get, get away
Get, get away
Get, get away from
Get, get away from me
Get, get away
