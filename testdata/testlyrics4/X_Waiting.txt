You caught my eye and I will never be the same
I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm anxious to know your name

Could you be tempted to give me a chance
And a few other things I need to know: do you love and leave 'em?
When you got them believin' that you'll never go

[Chorus:]
Oh you, you keep me waiting, waiting for you
Anticipating, what can I do
You keep me waiting, I never knew that I'd still be waiting

I wish you'd realize when we can confide
Ah tell me, please tell me, you want to know what's really here inside
Is it love there in your eyes, or is it just a lie

[chorus] - waiting for you
[Solo]
I see lyin' in your eyes, and now I realize that
You, you keep me waiting, waiting for you
Anticipating, think we're all through
You kept me waiting, I never knew that I'd still be waiting

You, you keep me waiting, anticipating
You kept me waiting, waiting for you
