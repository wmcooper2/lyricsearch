I see them offering you gum 
I hear the swarming schoolkids' hum 
A tribe of polyester warriors spellbound 
They bring you offerings to please 

Like cigarettes or new LP's 
You'll have them on their knees and begging 
Just to play with your comb 
One glance from those two eyes 

Will seal your playground empire 
My oh my, what a sight for sore eyes, young Cleopatra 
My oh my, what a wonderful prize, young Cleopatra 
You'll never be a queen unless you do as you're told 

You wouldn't understand it being fourteen years old 
Don't ever give your love for free 
But then again, don't even let it be sold 
You have your teachers in a trap 

There's no age limit or no gap 
To who you set alight with firebombs...
I'm glad your father is my friend 
And now that school is at an end 

He's only an excuse for me 
To wait here at your palace gates 
One glance from those two eyes 
Will seal your playground empire 

Your school uniform looks grey on others and silver on you 
Your yellow wooden rule a golden sceptre to prove it's true 
You're at the youth club near the drums 
The young guitarist buzzer strums 

Anything his royal majesty wishes 
Your borrowed perfume fills the air 
Pale nostrils start to flare 
It's more than some can bear 

But this is your court and they are your dogs 
One glance from those two eyes 
Will seal your playground empire
