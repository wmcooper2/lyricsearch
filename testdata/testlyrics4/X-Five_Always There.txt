Always there 
I´m always there 
Always there 
I´m always there 

My place, my home 
Is where I don´t stand alone 
If you just call me 
I walk on running 

When you feel like home 
The wall is fallin' upon you 
Leave someday 
Just call me when you need me 
I´ll be there 

Always there 
I´m always there 
Whenever you just need a friend 
I want to care 
I´m tellin' you 
I´m always there 
I´m always there 
Don´t let nobody let you down alone..x2 

My mystery is hidden inside of me 
If I see through you 
When watch, will you do?
