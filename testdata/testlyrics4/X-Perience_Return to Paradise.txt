I walk on the water, oh she's so funny 
Her taste on my lips, like milk and honey 
I see crystal lights, I want to stay forever 

I want to stay, I dive in love's sweet gin ?
Now and today, I throw away my pain, 
I want to stay, I'm gonna live today, forever

The return to paradise, 
It's all so nice 
Beautiful 
I will dive into the light 
I'm glad to be in love 

The return to paradise, 
It's all so nice 
Beautiful 
I will dive into the light 
I'm glad to be in love 

So deep so endlessly 
So nice and hopefully 
She gives the kiss of life to me 

I want to seek the sea, the liquid skies 
The warm and tender lights, when days arise 
I want to feel surreal, I want to stay, forever 

I want to stay, I dive in love's sweet gin ?
Now and today, I throw away my pain, 
I want to stay, I'm gonna live today, forever

The return to paradise, 
It's all so nice 
Beautiful 
I will dive into the light 
I'm glad to be in love 

So deep so endlessly 
So nice and hopefully 
She gives the kiss of life to me 

The return to paradise, 
It's all so nice 
Beautiful 
I will dive into the light 
I'm glad to be in love 

The return to paradise, 
It's all so nice 
Beautiful 
I will dive into the light 
I'm glad to be in love
