I see stars in your eyes when my lips beg your lips to surrender,
Stars in your eyes when we kissed and you whispered you're mine.
Stars leave the sky but the night is so bright in their splendor.
Deep in your eyes, lovely stars still continue to shine.

No matter what dawn may bring, no matter what you may say,
There's always one little thing that always gives you away.
Stars in your eyes make me thrill with a thrill, oh so tender,
I realize love is ours by the stars in your eyes.
