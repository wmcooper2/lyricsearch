When you're near me I have difficulty respirating 
When you're near me I have difficulty concentrating 
When you're near me I have difficulty standing upright 
When you're near me I have difficulty sleeping at night 

I used to stand proud like a sphinx 
In a noble immovable state 
Then your heart nailed me under a jinx 
Now I'm feeling like a jellyfish 
Just a spineless wobbly jellyfish 
And it's great, great, so great 

I used to stand high like a pine 
Just a piece of emotionless wood 
When you put your body near mine 
Now I'm feeling like a jellyfish 
And it's good, good, so good 
I used to be an iceman 
Living in iceman town 
So I'm warning all you cool cool icemen 
You'd better be prepared to be melted right down 
Down 
When you're near me I have difficulty
