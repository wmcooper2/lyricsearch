I WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS
HOPING TO BE FOUND
DO YOU want to MEET
DO YOU want to FEED
THERE IS THIS EMPTY PLACE
IT'S THE HUNGER I FEEL INSIDE

THERE IS THIS KILLING GAME
AND MY HEAD WILL ROL
THERE IS THIS WAITING GAME
TODAY THERE IS THIS WALL
MY SOUL IS NOT MY OWN
TODAY I WANT TO FORGET
AT NIGHT I HEAR THIS CALL
PLAY THIS KILLING GAME

I LISTENED TO A NAME
LISTENED TO THE CRAVING
DO YOU REMEMBER
THERE WAS A TIME
A VERY MOMENT
THE ANGER I FEEL INSIDE
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN ALL COLOURS DIED
DO YOU REMEMBER
BLAND AND BLIND
ALL THE CRAVING WAS MINE

I WANT TO FORGET
SHADOWS
I WANT TO FORGET
SHADOWS

THERE IS THIS KILLING GAME
AND MY HEAD WILL ROLL
THERE IS THIS WAITING GAME
TODAY THERE IS THIS WALL
MY SOUL IS NOT MY OWN
TODAY I WANT TO FORGET
AT NIGHT I HEAR THIS CALL
PLAY THIS KILLING GAME
