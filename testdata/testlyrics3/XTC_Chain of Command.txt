How bright are the fires of thought 
In a chain of command 
How bright is the medical torch 
When it's put in our hand 

My microbes and I 
We can't wait to lay down and die 
We realize that we must be spent 
Like the cells that dissolve when a brainwave is sent 

How bright are the fires of thought 
In a chain of command 

How bright are the fires of thought 
In a chain of command 
How bright is the medical torch 
When it's put in our hand 

My blood group and me 
A body of soldiers are we 
To the wound we quickly flowed 
And we fought them with the weapons in our chemical code 

How bright are the fires of thought

My microbes and I 
We can't wait to lay down and die 
We realize that we must be spent 
Like the cells that dissolve when a brainwave is sent
