Ten thousand times, I couldn't make up my mind
Heard one million rhymes and stepped over a few lines
But now I felt sure, I wanted more of this
But what I felt for, left me in such a bliss
Where have you gone
Cuz you're, where I belong
But you're, where I can't be
And I, can't even see
Anything, anymore and I feel so sore
I feel so sore

And if you could be here I wouldn't need none of this, believe me
I can't disappear here, let me just leave all of this
Let me leave all of this way behind
Way behind

Since I've been back, I've been on your track
Trying to make up for the love I lack
It's a shame and a fact
I thought opposites attract
Well I was wrong, for so long
But it's so long gone
And I can't hold on, to what my own soul wants

If you could be here I wouldn't need none of this, believe me
I can't disappear here, let me just leave all of this
Let me leave all of this way behind
Way behind

And if you could be here I wouldn't need none of this, believe me
I can't disappear here, let me just leave all of this
Let me leave all of this way behind
Way behind
