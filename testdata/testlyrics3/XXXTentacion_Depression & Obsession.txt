Depression and obsession don't mix well
I'm poisoned and my body don't feel well
I hate her, it's hard to love how I feel my stomach turning
Make out hill, where we met
We let our lips do all the talking and now I'm nothing
Depression and obsession don't mix well
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
