When you complain and criticize
I feel I'm nothing in your eyes
It makes me feel like giving up
Because my best just ain't good enough
Girl, I want to provide for you
And do all the things that you want me to, but

Oh! Oh no, don't bring me down
I'm beggin' you darlin'
Oh! Oh no don't bring me down

Sacrifices, I will make
I'm ready to give as well as take
One thing I need is your respect
One thing I can't take is your neglect
More than anything, I need your love
Then troubles are easy to rise above

Oh! Oh no, don't bring me down
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh! Oh no, don't bring me down
