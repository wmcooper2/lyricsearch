All my brothers and sisters
All in all over ten billion listeners
Lend me your ear when you want to hear
The hypest and ripest sound of the year

Up and kiss the body
Boy, then pucka
Up and kiss the body
Boy, then pucka
Up and kiss the body
Boy, then pucka
Up and kiss the body
Boy then, boy then
Up and kiss 
Body body
Boy, then pucka
Up and kiss the body

Up and kiss the body
Boy, then pucka
Up and kiss the body
Boy then, boy then
Up and kiss 
Body body

Ok, jo this is it now bust it
And the mic will sing soon as I touch it
Do this smoothin', easy, light
So we might get high to hear the night.

Be nice relax and see by the back
If you ain't with that I'm a have to attack you with the bad rap
That could smack this mouth word face jack
So it'll start no crap.

Givin' a little bit of hearty so as you do to you
It in your ear hole ha,
I ain't goin' on like a sucker
And if you think so boy then pucka
Up and kiss the body this lyricist
Glow on the mic word up this groove is set
To soothe move you party people now it's time to.
