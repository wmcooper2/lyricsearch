Still, still, still
One can hear the falling snow
For all is hushed
The world is sleeping
Holy Star it's vigil keeping
Still, still, still
One can hear the falling snow

Sleep, sleep, sleep,
'Tis the eve of our Saviour's birth
The night is peaceful all around you
Close your eyes
Let sleep surround you
Sleep, sleep, sleep,
'Tis the eve of our Saviour's birth

Dream, dream, dream,
Of the joyous day to come
While guardian angels without number
Watch you as you sweetly slumber
Dream, dream, dream,
Of the joyous day to come
