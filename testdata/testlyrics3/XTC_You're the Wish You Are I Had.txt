What was I supposed to do? 
I turned around with the world and she simply was there 
My blood ran like ice right through 
She had your face and your lips 
And your eyes and your hair 

You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish that I had 

I wonder if she knows that when I made her up 
I made her eat an apple 
And I made her drink a cup or two 

Wish wish wish wish wish 
Wish wish wish wish wish for you 

Who'd believe me if I said 
I brought an angel to earth by the power of mind 
Think I'm going off my head 
She caught the same bus as me and she sat down behind 

You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish that I had 

Little did I know that on a rainy day 
All the little wishes I had put away 
Would bring you 

Wish wish wish wish wish 
Wish wish wish wish wish for you 

Well if wishing is bad bad bad 
Then send me to hell hell hell 
But If you take my wish away 
Then this cold world would burn as well 

You're the wish you are I had
