Pulling worms from the ground 
With your blue steal beak
You're choking on the dust 
Down in television creak
Spreading disease 
Amongst the already week
You're denying it all 
And you're making me sick

Depending on where you live
Is what your views are
Depending on where you live
Is what your views are

How does it feel
To get el Presidente
How does it feel
How does it feel
To take home a germ
How does it feel

Depending on where you live
Is what your views are
Depending on where you live
Is what your views are

And all the while I'm running to the red
I walk the night without a bed 
I play the game without a team
I wash my face but have no hands

This land is black
The birds have fled
To nests inside my head

This land is black
The birds have fled
To nests inside my head

How does it feel?
Spreading disease amongst the weak
Denying it all you're making me sick

Depending on where you live
Is what your views are
Depending on where you live
Is what your views are

Yeah, feel
Say, how does it feel?

I wanna figure everything out

All things bright and beautiful

Say, how does it feel?

Depending on where you live
Is what your views are
