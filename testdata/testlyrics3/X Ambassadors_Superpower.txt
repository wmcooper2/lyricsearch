I been reaching from the ground up
To the highest heights
I been cooking up a storm
And I feel alright

Got my head in the clouds
And my feet up off of the ground
I feel like death is chasing me down

But today, I'm gonna superpower, superpower
But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower
It's a bird, it's a plane, Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne
I got that, I got that, I got that superpower

I been picking up the short stick
Going from bad to worse
And ?
Come out dressed in furs

Got my head in the clouds
And my feet up off of the ground
I feel like death is chasing me down

But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower, superpower
But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower
It's a bird, it's a plane, Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne
I got that, I got that, I got that superpower

I'm gonna superpower, I'm superpower
But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower, superpower
But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower, superpower
But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower, superpower
But today, I'm, I'm gonna superpower
