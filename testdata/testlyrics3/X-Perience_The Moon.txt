I left the light on
Went out of my house
And sat on the stairs
The tv plays mtv
From somewere else
The moon will carry on
Goin' up and down forever
The channel is changed again
A voice of a man
Is telling the news
A hijacked plane
Two children cryin' in the rain
The moon will never sacrifice
It's energy and light
The war in the east
Is still goin' on
To kill anyone
A burning car
And bomb attacks in russia
