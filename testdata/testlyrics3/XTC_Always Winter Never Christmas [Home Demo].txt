Always winter but never Christmas
You won't open your box or kiss under this
How can I let you know? 

Always Easter but never egg giving
Crucify me, I just don't call this living
How can I let you know? 

Can't you hear the bells ringing out? 
Can't you hear the fishmongers shout? 
That the way to live is celebrate and give
Stop it being, always winter but never Christmas

Always aging but never birthday
Told your last joke and threw your mirth away
Oh how can I let you know? 
Always turkey time, never thanksgiving
Share some gold out, but don't just sit there sieving

How can I let you know? 

Can't you read the words upon the wall? 
Can't you hear the butcher boy's call? 
That we need to share, love between each pair
Stop it being, always winter but never Christmas

I'd unwrap you if you'd only step down from your tree
From your present, into some undone future with me

Always winter but never Christmas
Always that'mas but never this'mas
Oh how can I let you know? 

Can't you hear the bells ringing out? 
Can't you hear the fishmongers shout? 
That the way to live is celebrate and give
That we need to share, love between each pair
Warm it up
Always winter but never Christmas
