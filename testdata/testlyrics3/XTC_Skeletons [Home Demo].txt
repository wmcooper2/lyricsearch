I was following adventure, nothing mattered
And I knew best
I had a blood in my head, no one could shake it
Cause I knew best
But now I find
Remains of people that I left behind
I never took them wise
And now the skeletons tell me hit me now and then
Here come the skeletons to say I told you so again
Wish I'd done things differently
Cause skeletons don't set you free

I'd make a life for myself, I'd be a bigshot
Cause I knew best
I had high expectations, I was headstrong
And I knew best
All of my friends knew
What I was doing to the loving few
I know it's hard to chew
Cause now the skeletons tell me hit me now and then
Here come the skeletons to say I told you so again
Wish I'd done things differently
Cause skeletons don't set you free

Well, all I wanted was fame to feed my ego
And I knew best
Cause when you're high on success you get impressed
And I knew best

I knew best
