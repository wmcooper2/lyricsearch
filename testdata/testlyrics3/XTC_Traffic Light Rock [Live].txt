I'm out and I'm driving
Got my eyes set on romance
She says, "I've got a brand new thing
Want to show you this dance"

I say, "Am I learning it steady"
She say, "Look you're doing it already"

It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go all of the time
It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go all of the time

I'm out by the dance hall
Best buddy by my side
He says, "I've got a brand new car
I want to take for a ride"

I say, "Can we take Joan and Freddie'
He say, "No they ain't ready"

It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go all of the time
It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go all of the time

It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go all of the time
It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go all of the time
