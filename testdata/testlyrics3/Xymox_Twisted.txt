I think it started
The way you twist my words
This world can get so shallow
I feel so tired
I still loose myself in other voices
I can't help myself
The mirror must fall
It's falling to pieces
And I feel twisted
I don't want to be with you
A million night faces
Turning inside out
The lies in their hands
All I do is smile
I don't want to be like this
A million night faces
Turning inside out, inside out

The names on the wall
The pain to remember
I am not what I seem
I have to balance
I have to think
Can I give you something more ?
Christ on the cross
The faceless bodies
And angels calling to me
Please seduce me
Please let me use you

And I feel twisted
I don't want to be with you
A million night faces
Turning inside out, inside out
All I do is smile
Too many secret smiles
Heh , heh, sarah
Too many secret smiles
Heh , heh, sarah
I feel so twisted
I feel so twisted
Too many secret smiles
Heh , heh, sarah
So twisted,
Etc ...
