I 
Cry
Twice 
A week
In joy
Because everyday it's getting closer

Moving faster
Than a roller coaster
I'm looking forward to the day
I'm looking forward to the day
I stop breathing

I 
Dress
Real nice
In black
To remind 
Myself 
That I won't be coming back

Everyday 
It's getting closer
I'm looking forward to the day
I'm looking forward to the day
I stop breathing

I
Cry
Twice 
A week
With joy
Because everyday it's getting closer

Moving faster
Than a roller coaster
I'm looking forward to the day
I'm looking forward to the day
I stop breathing

I'm looking forward to the day
I'm looking forward to the day
I'm looking forward to the day
I stop breathing
