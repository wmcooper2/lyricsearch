Take me home 
Please take me home 
To the place where I was born 
Take me home, take me home, take me home 

I don't want any friends 
In my new home 
'Cause I'd prefer to stay 
There all alone 

You told me 
"I would like to be with you" 
Now you're gone 
And everything's so strange and new 

I love my friends 
And you know I miss them so 
I miss my friends children 
And I miss watching them grow 

Take me back to the place 
Where I was born 
'Cause it's the place where 
I feel like being home
