I think my watch has bust and so is time 
I borrowed all my love so nothing's mine 
There's nothing decent on the TV page 
Like a new town animal in a furnished cage 
It's gone eleven and the bar is shut 
I'm sitting waiting like a real good mutt 
I watch TV with an actor's rage 
Like a new town animal in a furnished cage
