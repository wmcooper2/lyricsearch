ALL AROUND EVERYBODY SHOUTS
THEIR INSIDES OUT, HEAR THE LAUGHING CROWD
THE WIND BLOWS COLD, SUMMERS GONE BY
WANDER ON THE BOULEVARDS
UP AND DOWN

IT'S WRITTEN IN THE STARS
IT'S WRITTEN ON THE WALLS
YOU WILL DEFY MY HEART
TAKE MY SOUL

THIS FRAME OF MY MIND BRINGS ME HERE
GOES UP IN FLAMES AND FADES AWAY
LIKE THE MIRROR SUCKED MY FACE
FROM ALL IT'S GRACE
LOST MY FAITH, LOST MY SIGHT
EYES LIKE ICE

OW!
SHE'S DEEPER THAN THE SKY
SHE'S MADE OF GOLD
SHE'S LIKE THE RISING SUN

IT'S WRITTEN IN THE STARS
IT'S WRITTEN ON THE WALLS
YOU WILL DEFY MY HEART
TAKE MY SOUL
FAITH, WRITTEN IN THE STARS
FAITH, WRITTEN ON THE STARS
FACE THE CHANGE OF LIFE
FACE THE CHAINS OF LOVE
