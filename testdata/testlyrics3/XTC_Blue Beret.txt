Life is sometimes shorter than you think
So take yourself a hike from the kitchen sink
Me, I like to roam
Wasn't built in a day
And night throws the stars in our way
Meanwhile on planet earth

Some people are dying for the right to say
Some people are dying 'cause the other people busy blowing them away
Well, we're all dying so we better have a ton of fun along the way
I say hats off, get your hats off, take your hats off, get your hats off
For the blue beret
Blue beret, blue beret

The wind has blown it off his head
And sent it spinning straight to nowhere
Nowhere to get ahead in this life

Life is sometimes longer than you need
Especially if it's thrown away on hate and greed
Well, me I like to think while the other fish swim
But sharks made a meal out of him
Meanwhile on bone dry land

Some people are dying for the right to say
Some people just want the right to say
Some people are dying 'cause the other people busy blowing them away
Some people are merely blown away
Well, we're all dying so we better have a ton of fun along the way
I say hats off, take your hats off, get your hats off, take your hats off
To the blue beret
Blue beret, blue beret

The wind has blown it off his head
And sent it spinning straight to nowhere
Nowhere to get ahead in this life
So just love your dog and don't kick your wife
Put down that knife, watch out the windows,
And blow your hat away
