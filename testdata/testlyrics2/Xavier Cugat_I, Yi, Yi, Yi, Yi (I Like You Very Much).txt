I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi
 
There's a girl in Rio de Janeiro
Who sings in a cafe
With a smile that's so entrancing
So sweet, so cute, so gay
When you go to Rio de Janeiro
Say you'll enjoy your stay
When she sings an American love song
In a South American way
 
I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, I like you very much
I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, I think you're grand
Why, why, why is it that when I feel your touch
My heart starts to beat, to beat the band
I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, like you to hold me tight
You are too, too, too, too, too, divine
If you want to be in someone's arms tonight
Just be sure the arms you're in are mine
Oh, I like your lips and I like your eyes
Would you like my hips to hips-notize you
Si, Si, Si, Si, Si, Si, see the moon above
Way, way, way, way, way, up in the blue
Si, Si, Si, senor I think I fall in love and when I fall
I think I fall for you
I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Si, Si, Si, Si
I, Yi, Yi, Yi can see, see that you're for me
 
I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, I like you very much
