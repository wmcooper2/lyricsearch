Who do I have?
Heaven and hell, my friend, my friend
I won't fit in here
Everything must end
Hello, from the dark side end
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? (my friend)
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon' end?
Voices in my head telling me I'm gonna end up dead

So save me, before I fall
So save me, I don't wanna be all alone
So save me, before I fall
So save me, I don't wanna be all alone
