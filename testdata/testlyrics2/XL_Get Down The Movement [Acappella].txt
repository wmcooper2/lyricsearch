Lately I'm skipping along the street
And I ask myself why
I'm walking in rhythm to a new beat
Must be the look in your eye

Get down
You are my music fill me up
Here I am
Keep it spinning till we drop
Ooh ooh yeah yeah

This is unusual
It's not like me
To be acting this way
I'm talking in riddles and poetry
No one understands what I say

Get down
You are my music fill me up
Here I am
Keep it spinning till we drop

I don't know why I gotta boogie
Could it be your standing by me
Everything I see so shiny now

Get down
You are my music fill me up
Here I am
Keep it spinning till we drop
Ooh ooh yeah yeah
