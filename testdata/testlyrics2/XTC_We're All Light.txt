And I won't take from you 

Don't you know 
'Bout a zillion years ago 
Some star sneezed, now they're paging you in reception 
Don't you know 
Jack and Jill-ion years ago 
Some dinosaur dropped the pail when it saw our reflection 

Don't you know 
We're all light 
Yeah, I read that someplace 
Don't you know 
We're all light 
Yeah, I read that someplace 
So you won't mind if I kiss you now 
Before indecision can bite 
Don't you know in this new Dark Age 
We're all light 

Don't you know 
At your fingertips arrayed 
There's a universe of atoms that thinks you're real something 
Don't you know 
Just a couple of lips away 
There's an revolutionary bean-feast whose insides are jumpin 

Don't you know 
We're all light 
Yeah, I read that someplace 
Don't you know 
We're all light 
Yeah, it's a bumper sticker someplace 
So you won't mind if I kiss you now 
We may hear the angels recite 
Don't you know in this new Dark Age 
We're all light 

And I won't take from you what you can't take from me 
And I'll leave nothing here that you can't use upon your trip 
And I won't take from you what you can't take from me 
And I'll leave nothing here but love and milk a' plenty for your tea 

Don't you know 
Upon the pillion of time's bike 
We roar onto the stage and too soon we're dead center 
Don't you know 
Buffalo Bill-ions raised his sight 
He's picking up the whole herd as soon as we enter 
So you won't mind if I kiss you now 
And maybe come on in for the night 
Don't you know in this new Dark Age 
We're all light 
We're all light 

And I won't take from you 
what you can't take from me 
And I won't take from you 
(you know where you itch, is a little tiny switch, and if you let me in, 
I can show you just the pin, that you put in the slot and the element gets hot, 
and the stuff just pours out) 
And I won't take from you 
What you can't take from me 
(all we're light) 
(kiss me now, kiss me now) 

And I won't take from you 
What you can't take from me 
And I won't take from you 
What you can't take from me
