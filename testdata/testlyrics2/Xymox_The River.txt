WHAT MAKES A MAN
WHAT MAKES A WOMAN
HAPPY
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WHAT MAKE YOU SAY
LOVE
SOME SAY'S IT'S LIKE THE RIVER
HOW IT RUNS TO THE SEA
LOVE COULD BE THE RIVER

ONE MILLION PEOPLE
HOPING TO FIND
THE RIVER

ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
LIKE A SPINE OF A TREE

IT'S ALL A RIDDLE TO ME
IT'S ALL A RIDDLE TO ME
TO ME
