Young hearts broken in
Stolen parts, secondhand
You came, you came around
I was dried up, was broken down

I can't find it, can't find it
The road I traveled on is gone
I can't find it, can't find it
And I can't go on

I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love cause I'm helpless, helpless
I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love

Fickle heart, fickle mind
I gave it all, she robbed me blind
When I met you, I was half a man
With half a heart and half a chance

I can't find it, can't find it
The road I traveled on is gone
I can't find it, can't find it
And I can't go on

I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love cause I'm helpless, helpless
I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love

I can't give you my love
I can't give up on you
Give you the stars up above
I can't

I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love cause I'm helpless, helpless
I can't give you love cause I'm loveless, loveless
I can't give you love
I can't give you love
I can't give you love
