We smelled your soup on the fire cooking 
We saw your toys and your pencils looking bright 
So bright
And yet they come from oh, so far away 

We heard your flags and your banners flapping 
We felt the air from from your hands all clapping time 
In time
I'm sure your time is not so far away 

Millions, all moving forward 
Millions, all babbling crossword 
Millions, all flow as water 
Millions, all bright with laughter 
He make you glowing 
He bake you golden like the Yangtse mud 

I saw your writing on paper landing 
Your stamps showed bridges and temples standing still 
So still
And yet they're standing oh, so far away 

I, I, I, I, I saw you asking for western thinking 
I say it's poison that you'll be drinking 
Stay as East
As far away as dreams will let you be
