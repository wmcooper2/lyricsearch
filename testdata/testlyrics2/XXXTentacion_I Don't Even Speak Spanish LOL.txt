Mamita vente
Mamita vente, olvida la gente
Sé que tu cuerpo me pide calor
Y sé lo que sientes, la noche te prende
No te preocupes, me gustan mayor
Girl you know you got me feeling you the way you move
Baby bring it closer and let me show you what to do
Move it side to side, I know you want a drink or two
Let me have your body, let me show it what I can do
Mami, eres tú quien me provoca
Cuando chupa ella sí se pone loca
Hazlo lento pero quítate la ropa
Enséñame rodillas y abre boca

Mami what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby get your vibe and pour another cup
Girl I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride I wanna show you love

Sway you like a lullaby
Dance with me through the night
Back to mi casa baby slide
Let me make you feel alright
Sway you like a lullaby
Dance with me through the night
Back to mi casa baby slide
Let me make you feel alright

Got me caught up in the vibe, lil' mama let's go
I'm a make you shine in the night time (baby)
Rolling with a star, you could be my angel
Just back that booty up at the right time
I can feel you when you dance, you grabbing all on my pants
I'm kissing you in advance, baby live it up
She putting me in a trance
I'm throwing out all my bands
She yelling out this is a jam
DJ turn it up

She want it, she want it
We going hard 'til 6 in the morning
She need it, she need it
I bet the neighbors know my name when she on it

Mami what you doing all alone in the club
Baby get your vibe and pour another cup
Girl I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride I wanna show you love

Sway you like a lullaby
Dance with me through the night
Back to mi casa baby slide
Let me make you feel alright

Girl let me feel you right
Baby you in for a night
Come with me for the vibe
Know I wanna get inside
Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down
Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down

Bye
Dance with me through the night
Back to mi casa baby slide
Let me make you feel alright
