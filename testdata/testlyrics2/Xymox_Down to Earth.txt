Hope to see a strangers face
Calling out loud, come and embrace
Lull me to sleep, prolong my dreams
Hoping to find a strangers fate
Down to the summer seas
Down in a strangers hand
Holding my dream

I feel like a saint falling down to earth
I feel like an anger falling down
We don't understand her ways
We don't understand her days

I feel like a common man hanging around
Hope to find a strangers trace
Calling out loud, trapped in a maze
Give me a key and rescue me
Longing to read a strangers hand
Drown in the summer seas
Drown near a strange land
Cling to a dream

I feel like a saint falling down to earth
I feel like an anger falling down
We don't understand her ways
We don't understand her days
