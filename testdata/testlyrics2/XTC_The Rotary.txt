Thanks to Erich Sellheim  
I'm warning you 
I'm warning you now 
Look out people as it's the holy cow 

It's the rotary 
I told you 'bout the spinning top 
And that's a dance you gotta drop 
Because the rotary is in 

The rotary, the rotary 
The dance you've got to top is the brand-new spinning top 
That's out, this is the rotary 
The rotary 

This is a thing that's definitely gonna make Captain Beefheart 
And His Magic Band look bad 
They thought they had it with the "blimp" 
Well I'm talking to you about the rotary 

People will be coming, will be twirling, twirling, twirling, twirling 
The rotary 
You can jump it, I can jump it 
Everybody can jump it 

Grab an armadillo, grab your husband, grab anybody 
The rotary 
The rotary, the rotary, oh, the rotary 
It's the thing that's for me and you 

Ooh, ooh, the rotary 
I can see the precision 
They're lining up, falling over 
They're going crazy 

They can't get enough of the rotary 
Yes, siree 
The rotary 
Turning, turning, turning, turning... 

You're burning, burning, burning... 
With the rotary, ooh 
Yes, siree 
The rotary 

I shouldn't want you to get this confused with any other dance craze 
Because this is the one 
Oh, the rotary 
You'll be burning all your clothes 

And you'll be burning all of your jewellery 
You will be the rotary 
It's nothing like anarchy 
No, siree 

It's, it's the rotary 
The rotary, the rotary... 
R.O.T.A.R.Y. 
Rotary, the rotary 

You'll want to do it, do it with me 
You'll want to do it, you can do it for free 
The rotary 
Go on Terry, play the rotary 

How do you think he got the second half of his name? 
Terry is the last part of Rotary 
Drum it up, drum it up...
