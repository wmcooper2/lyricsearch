I wan?t to play a melody
I want to sing a song
Come, sing it with me
A sweet melody
We want to shout it out
That we are going to be free
Come sing it with me
We're going to be free
Open your eyes
And you will realize
We are what we are
We're going to fight
To fight for our right
We are what we are
We want to feel like beeing free
Free as a bird can be
It?s only a dream
But dreams can come true
We want to leave the bad times
We leave everything behind
We leave everything behind
And we sing
