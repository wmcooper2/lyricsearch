Never seen her glowing
All that bright she's throwing like some aurora
From her head it's growing
Reaching to the ground
And all around like a Navaho blanket

Never heard her singing
Now she's gently ringing like copper wind chimes
What on earth is bringing
Up this stream the cat who got the cream is licking her lips
And smiling like her Cheshire cousin

She claims she's found a way to make her own light
All you do is smile, you banish the night

She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away, away
She says she's burning up all her guilts and shames, away, away
She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away, away
She says she's burning up

Now you see I'm smiling
Back to juvenile'ing
I learnt her lesson in like flint and styling
All the world is neatly curled
Around my littlest finger

I can't stop this grinning
So assume I'm winning
Threw pessimism in the air, it's spinning
Crashing to the floor and nevermore will it lure me away
With sweets and shiny things just like a magpie

She claims she's found a way to make her own light
All you do is smile, you banish the night

She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away, away
She says she's burning up all her guilts and shames, away, away
She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away, away
She says she's burning up

Now every bird and bee just fuel the fire for me
Now every closing door just fans the flames some more

She claims she's found a way to make her own light
All you do is smile, you banish the night

She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away
She says she's burning up all her guilts and shames, yeah
She says she's burning with optimism optimism's flames, hey
She says she's burning up

Now I'm thinking okay
I'm turning night into day
