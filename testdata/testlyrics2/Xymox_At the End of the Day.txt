YOU'LL LAUGH IF ONLY YOU KNEW
THE NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY
I'VE WANTED TO KISS YOU
I'VE WANTED TO HOLD YOU
CLOSER TO MY HEART
CLOSER THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE
I FELT THIS FROM THE START
BUT WHAT CAN I DO,
WHAT CAN I SAY
AT THE END OF THE DAY
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU
AT THE END OF THE DAY
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU

THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU
IN THE CORNER OF MY EYES
WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN
YOU LOOKED SO ALIVE THAT NIGHT
OHH, IT MUST BE A HUNDRED STARES...FADING
TODAY, WHEN I THINK OF YOU
TODAY, WHEN I THINK OF YOU
WHAT CAN I DO
WHAT CAN I SAY
AT THE END OF THE DAY
TO PROVE MY LOVE FOR YOU
MY LOVE FOR YOU
MY LOVE FOR YOU
MY LOVE FOR YOU
MY LOVE FOR YOU
