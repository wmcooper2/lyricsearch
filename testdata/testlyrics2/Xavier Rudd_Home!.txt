Streets full of people with trinkets to share
Offerin' them up for the folks in despair
Yandi and crystals and oils for growth
Of spirit and body and mind as we go

Emphasis placed on the body and mind
As the heart is often somewhere behind
Strange

Tiny little bones of the innocent child
Lookin’ up at me with the saddest of eyes
Is her innocence in tact? Or has it been stained?
Has the creature that feeds her taken it away
Strange, so sad it's strange

I recognize my health
Things that I have been dealt
Places that I have roamed
Feelin's I've had and things that I know

Home, I’m home
Home, I'm home, home, home, home
Home, I'm home

Runnin' through the bush and all of the trees
Movin' in time with my capable speed
Skippy ants claw at the edge of the bowl
Of the shell of an egg, of bird long since gone
Maybe it rose up to spread it's new wings
Or maybe it nourished a stronger siblin'
Strange

Places we roam and people we meet
Some connections are strong
And some of them are weak
1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or maybe 5 or 6 or more

Strong as the roots of a big old gum tree
And we'll carry them through
To the next life we see, strange
So beautifully strange

Recognize my health
Things that I have been dealt
Places that I have roamed
Feelin's I've had, things that I know

Home, I’m home
Home, I'm home, home, home, home
Home, I'm home
