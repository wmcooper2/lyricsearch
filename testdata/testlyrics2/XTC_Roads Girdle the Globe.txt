Am I asleep 
Or am I fast 
Your every race 
You first, you last 

Roads girdle the globe 
We safe in your concrete robe 
Hail mother motor 
Hail piston rotor 
Hail wheel 
Roads girdle the globe 

Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh

Am I tied in 
Or do I turn 
Your only incense 
You tire burn 

Roads girdle the globe 
We safe in your concrete robe 
Hail mother motor 
Hail piston rotor 
Hail wheel 
Roads girdle the globe 

Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh

Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 
Steer me Anna 

Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh

Am I get there 
When is A, B 
Your iron, oil and steel 
Your sacred three

Roads girdle the globe 
We safe in your concrete robe 
Roads girdle the globe 
We safe in your concrete robe 
Roads girdle the globe 
We safe in your concrete robe 
Roads girdle the globe 
We safe in your concrete robe 
Hail mother motor
