Changes all around and everytime
And everything is changed in my head
I'm longing for a change
I wouldn't beg but for a change
I never will get
I spend my time in learning
Everytime I learn I turn blue into red
My life goes on
I just wanna have fun
Leaving shadows into the sun
I get in troeble with some friends of mine
They've told me there is no need to change
We quarrel it becomes a colder time
And now I'm freezing down to the bones
Nothing changes but I've lost 2 friends
And that depends on changing myself
