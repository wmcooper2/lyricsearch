Lately I've been thinking
You've seen the worst and you've seen it in me
I gave you every reason
Every reason to get up and leave

I know that there's times
That you get so tired
And you know I want you to stay

But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me

Baby, I've been thinking
That you've been hurt and it's because of me
Oh woah, oh woah
Baby, my ship is sinking
So don't go over, don't try to save me

I know that there's times
That you get so tired
And you know I want you to stay

But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me

Oh woah, oh woah
Oh woah, oh woah

Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
