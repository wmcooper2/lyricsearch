LONELY
AS LONELY AS I CAN BE
SLOWLY
AS SLOW AS TIME CAN BE
I STARED INTO THE SEA
I STARED OUT TO THE WAVES
SLOWLY AS SLOW AS WAVES CAN BE

WHEN WILL YOU COME TO ME
WHEN WILL YOU COME TO ME

WHERE THE SUMMER BURNS BLUE AND GREEN
HERE ON THIS BURNING SAND
I LISTENED TO THIS HUNGRY SEA
IT'S FALLING ON THE LEVEL SHORES
AND THE WIND BLOWS THROUGH THE TREES
AND I THINK OF YOU
AND I THINK OF THE DAYS
IF ONLY I COULD SEE YOUR FACE
THE PRICE OF A HOLIDAY

HOPE THE WIND WILL CARRY ME AWAY
HOPE THE WIND WILL CARRY ME AWAY
LISTEN, LISTEN
LISTEN TO THE SIREN
HEAR YOUR VOICE
YOUR VOICE CRIED BY THE RIVER
SLOWLY, SLOWLY
IT FLOWS TO THE SEA
WHEN WILL YOU COME TO ME
WHEN WILL YOU COME TO ME
