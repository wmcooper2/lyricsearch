Maybe it's time I change religions on you turning Christians
To a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it
Sipping red wine inside the pentagon
Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watching ESPN
My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians
Explain I'm a sick fucking psychotic master
The mic is my sword the booth is your casket
I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet
Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit
Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes
Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth

They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor
Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more
Slim the mobster am I is really made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfucking movie

Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie

Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada
The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X

Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the american eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars
Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie

Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie
