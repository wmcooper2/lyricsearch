Yeah.. yo.. c'mon
Ride wit me, lemme take you somewhere

My father was a soldier, my mother was a rider
I was born wit my fists balled up, I'ma fighter
Inspired, a real rhyme writer
Get past the past the future looks brighter
But, I want to get it back to the way it was
Exchange blows, elbows and it was still love
A better time, better place in space
Cause nothin can erase, shame tat' like my nigga Chase
Cause Bigga be	 will never be replaced, right
And I'ma scream it to the whole fuckin human race
Get a bar, get a taste
Enforce the muscle to ya hustle and ya did it with grace
Cause real niggaz don't save face, they make movements
Back to the time when hip-hop was music
When N.W.A. got booed at the Apollo
Broke "Straight Outta Compton" and the whole world followed
Cause right now hip-hop is hollow
With no substance, X-Man with the roughness
Cause success can suck sometime
And many of us the way we act, we even lost our minds

[Chorus]
You can hold your breath, 'til your blue in the face
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on (now sing the song wit me)
You can speculate, on every breath I take
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on

Back to the day when +Cooley+ was +High+
Hustle big like Butch in the why-be	-I
We did it 'n died, the gang still multiplied
Sock yo windpipe, cut yo air supply
Hypnotized, not by the glitz 'n glamour
So fuck them cameras, all I need is clips and hammers
The X-Man said that the first rhyme out
Were my fans worth my time? The first line out, so
Here we are eight years strong and still movin
Groovin with a reputation ya can't ruin
I want to take it back how it used to be
Five thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity

[Chorus]

Was it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame
that made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?
Played those games nigga when I was younger in life
'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife
Lose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us
Ya can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us
When times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic
Never been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard
But I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor
I never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster
I move in silence, speak with violence
Think with science, live free and walk with lions
Cats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat
It takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Pounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about
It's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth
It's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out
Don't let the things that you can't change stress you out
Cause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son
And change the world with the power of one c'mon

[Chorus]
