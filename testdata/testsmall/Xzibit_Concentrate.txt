8X Nam Myoho Renge Kyo 

Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate 
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate 

Meditate, levitate 
Greetings from the Golden State 
Mr. X, to the Z 
Concentrate, come walk with me 
Your shit sound so awkwardly 
I don't rhyme I just stomp down beats 
Real estate, section eight 
Which one would you rather take? 
Concentrate, move that weight 
Show me how you regulate 
Hold up, wait, that shit's fake 
Get these n----s up out my face 
Shake the room, bend the spoon 
Turn this up now, stay in tune 
Hypnotized by the way she move 
Take your time you might arrive too soon 

[Chorus One] 

[Chorus Two] 
Bring that back, what was that? 
Oh my lord, she got back 
So precise, so deattached 
Oh my God, who is that? 

Hibernate, consummate 
Man was made to procreate 
My estate, generates 
As if my family name was Gates 
Days of grace, lift big plates 
Why be good nigga, go be great 
Hit the breaks, crack them crates 
Have you on the run goin state to state 
Contemplate, demonstrate 
Mind over mayhem, no mistakes 
Lift some weights, eat some steaks 
But you don't really want that face to face 
But let's relax, check your traps 
Don't let yo' concentration snap 
I love the way she arch her back 
Like how a muh'f--ker 'sposed to handle that? 

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two] 

Breath control, touch yo' soul 
Just maintain don't lose control 
Participate, congratulate 
Cause everything else'll be seen as hate 
Remain in place, the same mindstate 
Get off yo' ass and celebrate 
Congregate, associate 
Don't f--k yo'self procrastinate 
Dilate, to an all time great 
Calculate the next move I make 
Crack the safe, keep that ace 
In my waistband just in case 
I'm no rat can't run yo' race 
Not too good don't fit my taste 
I love the way she make that shake 
Makin it hard to concentrate 

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]
