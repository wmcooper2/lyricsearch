Your way
Not my way
Seekers on the highway
Yesterday's

Not far enough way
I've got to turn it off
'Cause at the end of the day
Caught between the poles

The nearer to the end I get
I take one step forward
And two steps back
'Til the morning catches up

And passes through me
I wear ruthless
I wear loaded boots

I wear ruthless leaded boots
Read clueless loaded books
Give sneaky sideways looks
In a land of too many cooks

I have to cry
Basta
Enough
All men hold me down

Don't do the things you know
I know the things you do
Basta
Enough

Basta
I've been bad, I've been bad, I've been bad
I've been bad

(Boom boom shakkalakka boom boom)

Don't get up
Don't go out

Rah
'Cause you should
If you can
And you can

But you won't
So you won't 
So you won't 
Yes you yes you can

But you can't 
Won't try
Don't dare
Can't do

Won't feel
Can't please
Can but you won't
So you won't 
You won't

Just a little more
Just a little more
Just a little more
Just a little more

Lee way

Basta
Enough
Basta
Enough

Got no head
Lots of room
For fresh perfume
And golden bloom

[lots of -ate words I can't decypher]
Hesitate
