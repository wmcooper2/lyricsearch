Foreign Spanish jawn, I really like your lemonade
I put Cartiers all over my bitch's face
She just got apparel, all because a nigga paid
Put her in the past, 'cause you know

Yeah, you know, I smashed
Yeah, I smashed, yeah
Shawty let me smash
So I put her in the past, yeah
I put her in the past, yeah, I smashed, yeah
Yeah, you know, I smashed (yeah)
So I put her in the past
Yeah I put her in the, smash

She rock Carti' frames, sweet like candy canes
If I'm Superman, she my Lois Lane
Gucci everything, Louis everything
Had to cut her off, she sniff too much 'caine
Don't look so surprised, all she want to do is lie
Then she turned around and cried
Demons all in her eyes
She don't feel no pain, she might be insane
Coat her with some rain, pussy lemonade
