IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
THOUGHTS ARE SCATTERED, ALL BLOWN AWAY
FRUITS OF LOVE ARE GONE
LISTEN TO THIS WOMAN'S ONLY SONG
SHE'S DOWN ON HER KNEES
KICKING HER HEELS
A FALLEN ANGEL OUT OF LOVE

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
THOUGHTS ARE SCATTERED AND BLOWN AWAY
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
THOUGHTS ARE SCATTERED AND BLOWN AWAY

YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE DOOR
SWEPT UNDER THE CARPET
DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE
DISCOVERY OF INFIDELITY
FALLING FROM GRACE
SACRIFICE THE SUBSTANCE
MARK THE DAYS
HEAR THIS WOMAN'S SONG
FOREVER BETRAYED
IN SECRET WE KNOW IT'S NOT HER OWN
STARING FROM MIRROR TO MIRROR
NO ONE'S COMING HOME

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
THOUGHTS ARE SCATTERED AND BLOWN AWAY
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
THOUGHTS ARE SCATTERED AND BLOWN AWAY
AWAY
