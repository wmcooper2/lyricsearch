You took me
Down down down
Down a peg

Thank you
For taking me down a peg
Thank you
It's true
My position had gone to my head
Thank you
Like some commissionaire who has ideas above his station
Or some jumped up councilor who think he's lord of creation

You took me down down down down a peg
Down down down down a peg

Thank you
For bringing my feet to the floor
Thank you
It's true
My head wouldn't go through the door
Thank you
Sometimes this job puts you so high you forget your roots now
Only my folks see I'm getting too big for my boots now

You took me down down down down a peg
Down down down down a peg
Down down down down a peg

Thank you
For taking me down a peg
(you took me down down down down a peg)
Thank you
It's true
My position had gone to my head
(you took me down down down down a peg)
Thank you
