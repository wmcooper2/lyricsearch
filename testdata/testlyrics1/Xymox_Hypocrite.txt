Did you think I was so stupid I was really gonna cry
Did you think I was so stupid I was gonna let you try
To crawl inside me with your twisted little lies
And let you find your way into my mind
I nearly........cried, I nearly......died

Did you ever try to cross your heart and hope to die?
Did you ever try to cross your heart and hope to die?

So one day there was a moment you made me realize
That velvet words coming from your mouth are filled with poisoned lies
The worst thing that I could do was to put my trust in you
I wish I lost you there and then, never to be seen again
Never again, never again

Let me see your lying, deceiving, cheating , pretentious face 
Let me wipe that charming, deceitful, cunning grin of your face
I've seen people just like you
Deceiving people just like me
It always ends in misery
It always turns to hostility
Your loss becomes my gain
Your loss becomes my gain

Did you ever try to cross your heart and hope to die?
Did you ever try to cross your heart and hope to die?
hope to die, hope to die

I've given you my friendship , my friendship you betrayed
The more I get to know you, the less I want to know
I don't want to see you, I'm feeling whole again
I' m feeling whole again

Did you ever try to cross your heart and hope to die ?
If you ever tried you would have realized
That you're the one that I despise
That you're the one that I despise
