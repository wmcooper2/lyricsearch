Hey, hey, 
The clouds are whey.
There's straw for the donkeys, 
And the innocents can all sleep safely, 
All sleep safely. 

My, my, 
Sun is pie.
There's fodder for the cannons, 
And the guilty ones can all sleep safely, 
All sleep safely. 

And all the world is football-shaped
It's just for me to kick in space
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste
And I've got one, two, three, four, five 
Senses working overtime
Trying to take this all in. 
I've got one, two, three, four, five 
Senses working overtime 
Trying to taste the difference
'Tween a lemon and a lime
Pain and the pleasure
And the church bells softly chime. 

Hey hey, 
Night fights day. 
There's food for the thinkers, 
And the innocents can all live slowly, 
All live slowly. 
My, my, 
The sky will cry 
Jewels for the thirsty, 
And the guilty one's can all die slowly ,
All die slowly. 

And all the world is biscuit-shaped, 
It's just for me to feed my face, 
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, 
And I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime 
Trying to take this all in. 
I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime 
Trying to taste the difference, 
'Tween a lemon and a lime, 
Pain and the pleasure, 
And the church bells softly chime, 

And birds might fall from black skies, 
And bullies might give you black eyes, 
And busses might skid on black ice,
But to me they're very, very beautiful
(England's glory!) 
Beautiful
(A striking beauty!) 

And all the world is football-shaped, 
It's just for me to kick in space, 
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, 
And I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime 
Trying to take this all in
I've got one, two, three, four, five 
Senses working overtime
Trying to tell the difference
'Tween the goods and grime
Turds and treasure 
And there's one, two, three, four, five 
Senses working overtime 
Trying to take this all in
I've got one, two, three, four, five
Senses working overtime
Trying to taste the difference
'Tween a lemon and a lime
Pain and the pleasure, 
And the church bells softly chime.
