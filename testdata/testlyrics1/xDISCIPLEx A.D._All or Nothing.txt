I'm not asking no more I'm begging I'm not condemning 
I'm understanding coming to the point of realization 
I fallow my heart this is my life and I will fight for what I believe 
I eiil not lay down and die I won't sell out and buy what this world is trying to sell to me all or Nothing I've got to fight back I've come to the point where it's do or die 
I know it's not a lie I've crossed the line it's all or nothing I'm not asking I'm begging 
I'm not reaching I'm taking all or nothing.
