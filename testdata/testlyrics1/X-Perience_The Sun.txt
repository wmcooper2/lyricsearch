The sunrise in the east
Every morning in my dreams
I turn the music on
And start to dance
With all my friends
The sun shines on my way
Every night and every day
And takes the sorrows far away
So far away
The sunset in the west
Every evening in my dreams
The party is going on
I love to dance
With all my friends
The sun shines on my way
Every night and every day
A easy way of life
Gonna make me dance
With all my friends
