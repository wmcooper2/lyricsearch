If I was to tell my child
Tell her what I think is right
Where do I start with her?
Where will I find the words?

And in the end
I’ll trust in you
To see me through
And until then

You’ll have to trust in me
To do the same for you
Maybe these words
Are like nothing you’ve heard

But hear me out
Please hear me out
You have all that you need
Please believe

You can trust in me
You can trust in me
That in the end
I’ll trust in you
And until then

You’ll have to trust in me
To do the same for you
So what do you say?
If one of these days

I’ll be following you
I’ll be following you
Because in the end
I’ll trust in you

To see me through
And until then

You’ll have to trust in me
To do the same for you
And in the end
I’ll trust in you

To see me through
And this trust in me
Is the same trust in me
That trusts you
