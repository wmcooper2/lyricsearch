Revolt! 
You make me lose my mind, make me forget what's rigth, 
You make me lose everything I always had to fight for, 
Make me lose control, you make lose my soul, 
You make me lose everything I always stood up for 
It's time to take a stand, I've go to find a solution, 
It's time for me to plant, the plant of a revolution 

[Chorus:] 
Revolution 
It's time for a revolution 
I won't be satisfied till violence has died 
Now don't you know that you're the reason why the people cry 
About the dreams you kill bout all the graves you fill 
Bout all precious blood you always had to spill 
It's time to take a stand... 

[Chorus ]
Revolt! 
Man I've got to come down, down to reality, 
Conspiracy rules the world and we 
Can't close our eyes about the fact 
That disrespect lets the world be divide 
D in first, second, and third, 
Though that will always be so and all I know, 
Is that I have to show you that ain't right, 
And it's our plight to fight for the rights of the weak 
And that's why we need this RE-VO-LU-TION 
Chorus
