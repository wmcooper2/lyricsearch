MORNINGS WHEN I WAKE TOO EARLY
THERE'S A DEAD LIGHT IN THE ROOM
RAIN IS FALLING THROUGH
THE DARK AND THE MOON
THE WAKING HOUR APPEARS PRETTY SOON
EVERYONE IS SLEEPING THOUGH
I LIE IN A CURTAINED ROOM

SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
HOLDING SO MANY NAMES
SOMEHOW IN THE DISTANCE
I'VE GONE TO GROUND
SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE CROWD
SOMEHOW IN THE DISTANCE
I'VE GONE TO GROUND

ONLY THE SHADOW REMAINS
ONLY THE SHADOW OF DOUBT
THREE YEARS OF MEMORIES
MEMORIES WITHOUT A SIGHT
THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR
HOW WILL I SURVIVE ?
HOW SUDDENLY FEAR BEGINS
IN A BEDROOM ON THE FLOOR

SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
HOLDING SO MANY NAMES
SOMEWHERE IN THE CROWD
SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE
SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
HOLDING SO MANY NAMES
SOMEHOW IN A CITY
I'VE GONE TO GROUND

THE LIGHT BREAKS SLOWLY FORWARD
ACROSS MY BEDROOM WALL
UNTIL IT DEFINES ME SOMEHOW
IN SHADOW OF DOUBT
IT FINDS MY FUGITIVE LIFE
IT'S BLURRED, BLURRED WITH DUST
ONLY HEAVEN COLLIDES
WHEN I LOOK ABOVE

SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
HOLDING SO MANY NAMES
SOMEHOW IN THE DISTANCE
I'VE GONE TO GROUND
SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE CROWD
SOMEHOW IN THE DISTANCE
I'VE GONE TO GROUND

SOMEWHERE IN A CITY
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE CROWD
SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE
I'VE GONE TO GROUND
