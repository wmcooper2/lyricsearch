The tightope I walk everyday you choose your own path and I'll choose mine you self centered life that's where I draw the line your age of reason you let me down show no discipline I'll kiss the ground age of reason let me down vanity and selfishness in shallow water I won't drown I won't kneel down for you and kiss your hand of hope I'll cope and deal with what's inside me not how you deceive to believe in your lies humanitys destruction is what you leave behind.
