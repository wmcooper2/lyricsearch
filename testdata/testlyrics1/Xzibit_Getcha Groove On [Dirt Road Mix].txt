Millennium shit
Limp Bizkit X to the Z yeah
Bringin' it live to you and yours
Ladies and gentlemen
My homeboy yo
Get at em, dog

You don't want to fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' didn't go your way
So try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way

We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck if your invading the space
So getcha getcha your groove on
Don't keep us waitin' too long

Don't you treat me like a toy kid
Do you enjoy this
Every single second I'm alive, I'm a mess
Got these laser beam mic checks
Communicating through the Genelec
High tech, keep you on the run

Now don't wanna be that guy
Every single second I'm alive
I'm alive I don't understand why
I got your trunk full of candy
And your so high bumping off the sweetness

This is what you need
Another little piece of me inside you
'Cause you know that I'll always keep it true
And that's exactly what I do
It's what I do it's what I do

You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' didn't go your way
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way

We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space
So getcha getcha get your groove on
Don't keep us waiting too long

I got breakneck delivery, no time for chivalry
Extraordinary ability, shit longevity
Dig deep in your soul and find yourself
'Cause mind control could turn y'all to someone else

So fast your head'll probably spin the fuck right off
Me and Fred about to go half on Microsoft
Them live earning twenty percent
Those little half-assed direct hits
Ain't even making a dent

What an event, ah Hell, Xzibit and Limp
As we attempt to bring home
The championship it's all in the risk
I'll still lead the league and assist
Give me the fifth I'm drinking while I'm taking a piss, bitch

You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' didn't go your way
So try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way

We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space
So getcha getcha get your groove on
Don't keep us waiting to long

I got untapped material, I serial kill shit give me that real shit
X finish em off quick, makin' your jaw split
When I'm touching the mosh pit
Constant conflict knockin' faggot's unconscious
Nauseous raisin' the stakes

Increasin' the weight
Got homies that can lay down and lift the plate
So, quit tryin' to invade my space
Before I call for a face-to-face
And got to rest my case like

This is how we do it
Just recognize we keep gettin' right to it
Lookin' into these eyes
Lookin' into these eyes
And you'll see the size of the flames
Then you might despise the size of my game

Step the fuck back, Xzibit's on the track
You should have buckled up before your head hit the dash
You gotta hate that demo from an eight-track
Brought me to a place where platinum comes in eight stacks, bitch

You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' go your way
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way

We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space
So getcha getcha your groove on
Don't keep us waitin' too long

You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' go your way
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way

We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space
So getcha getcha your groove on
Don't keep us waitin' too long

You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' go your way
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way

We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space
So getcha getcha your groove on
Don't keep us waitin' too long

You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little some, somethin' go your way
