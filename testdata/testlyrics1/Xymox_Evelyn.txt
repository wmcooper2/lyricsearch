WE WALKED TILL THE SUNLIGHT DIED
HOW COULD I BREATHE WITHOUT YOUR LOVE
LIKE OTHERS WE ALL FIGHT
AGAINST THE CRUEL CRUEL TIME

A HUNDRED TIMES A YEAR
THE WIND BLOWS
A HUNDRED TIMES A YEAR
THE WIND BLOWS THROUGH MY SKIN
THROUGH MY SKIN

ALL THE CHOICES AND MANY VOICES
KEEP ON TELLING ME
IT'S YOU, EVELYN
IT'S YOU, EVELYN

WE TALKED ABOUT WRONG OR RIGHT
I COULDN'T AGREE I HAD TO SHOUT
SOMETIMES WE ALL MUST FIGHT
AGAINST THE CRUEL HEART OF DOUBT

A HUNDRED TIMES A YEAR
WE FIND OUT
A HUNDRED TIMES A YEAR
WE FIND OUT
BY EXPERIENCE

ALL THE CHOICES AND MANY VOICES
KEEP ON TELLING ME
IT'S YOU, EVELYN
IT'S YOU, EVELYN

YOU KEEP THE RAIN FROM FALLING
YOU KEEP THE RAIN FROM FALLING
DOWN ON ME
EVELYN
EVERYTHING WILL DIE FOR YOU
EVERYONE WILL CRY FOR YOU
EVELYN, EVELYN, EVELYN
YOU KEEP THE RAIN FROM FALLING
DOWN ON ME
EVELYN
