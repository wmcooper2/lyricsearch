I drank a rainbow but I could not get me drunk
All I could get me was blue,
Red round the eyes where I cried bout how green I'd been
Regarding you
And all the works you do
I took a jet plane but I could not get me gone
All I could get me was here,
Stuck in the dirt ankle deep, riches crashing in our atmosphere
No parachute hangs near

And I don't want to find myself this way again
I don't want to pick the thorny rose
I don't want to let love spoil the day again
But it may again, who knows
I don't want to be here

I smoked a forest but I could not get me lost
All I could get me was found
Gretel skips home and I rode on my hands and knees upon the ground
Our candy house melts down

And I don't want to find myself this way again
I don't want to pick the thorny rose
I don't want to let love spoil the day again
But it may again, who knows

Swallowed a mountain, but I could not get me high
All I could get me was low
Really marked down in your sale of the century
And we all know
That everything must go

And I don't want to find myself this way again (I don't wanna)
I don't want to pick the thorny rose
I don't want to let love spoil the day again
But it may again, who knows

I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here
(Where'd you want to be, who'd you want to be with, where'd you want to be)

I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here
(Where'd you want to be, who'd you want to be with, where'd you want to be)
