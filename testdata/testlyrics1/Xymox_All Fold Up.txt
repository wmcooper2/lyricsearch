Now the colours you've placed
On the canvas of our lives
Travel down those heavenly roads
Where all the essence shines

I wake and feel the day
As innocence fades wawy
All the warmth, all the love
Like gold in my hand
Assailed from high above

Until it falls apart
Assailed from high above
It all falls down
And it all falls down
Yeah yeah

Cover the window of your heart
And all the light will be gone
Walk through the soundless pass
When all is said and done
I wake and feel the day
As time slips away
All the warmth, all the love
Like gold in my hand

Assailed from high above
Until it falls apart
Assailed from high above
And it all falls down
