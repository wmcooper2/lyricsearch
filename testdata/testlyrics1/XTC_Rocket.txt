Cape Canaveral Florida, ready for takeoff stages
Zoom destination an isolated planet Mars
On which observed many relics of past ages
On return despite rocks no spars

2nd destination world's largest planet Jupiter
From there obtained some ancient relics
When returned at base -- we want Hoopiter!
And we would like some fancy cow's milk

3rd destinations many ringed planet Saturn
While there darted among the rings
At base had a few thoughts of astral matter
Again at base a welcoming with sings

4th zoom destination to an isolated planet Neptune
Whose surface was clear of any vegetation
At base quote -- would like large dirigible balloon
During when there was no hesitation

5th zoom destination smallest planet Pluto
On which there are many beautiful sights
It has no vegetation you know
No power to illuminate dark nights.
