I ain't no Ken and you ain't no Barbie
Ain't none of my friends have a perfect body
If we had it all, go, go
Baby, if we let it all go, go
Baby, we could break the mold, mold
Not afraid to show, I just wanna say

From my head to my toes
Feeling overexposed
I wanna be naked with you
All my faults, all your stars
Who I am, who you are
I wanna be, oh, naked with you, naked with you

No, we ain't no Brad and Angelina
Oh, we don't let that bother us either
If we let it all go, go
Maybe if we let it all go, go
Maybe we just let 'em all know, know
Not afraid to show, I just wanna say

From my head to my toes
Feeling overexposed
I wanna be naked with you
All my faults, all your stars
Who I am, who you are
I wanna be, oh, naked with you, naked with you

No more lies, no more hate
No more waiting in the wings
Take my hand, take this danger
I just wanna say

From my head to my toes
Feeling overexposed
I wanna be naked with you
All my faults, all your stars
Who I am, who you are
I wanna be, oh, naked with you, naked with you
