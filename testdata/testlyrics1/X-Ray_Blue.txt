Where have all my friends gone? 
They've all disappeared.
Turned around maybe one day, you're all that was there.
Stood by on believing, stood by on my own.
Always thought I was someone, turned out I was wrong. 
And you brought me through and you made me feel so blue, 
Why don't you stay behind?
So blue. Why don't you stop, and look at what's going down.

If I had an old woman she'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone who won't sing with you.
Give all of my mercy, give all of my heart.
Never thought that I'd miss you, that I'd miss you so much.
And you brought me through and you made me feel so blue.
Why don't you stay behind?
So blue. 
Why don't you stop and look at what's going down.

All my life (staying while) I'm waiting for (staying while) 
Someone I could (waiting around) show the door
(now that I'm blue) but nothing seems to change (that I'm blue from now on)
You come back that month so blue.
Why don't you stay behind? 
So blue.  
Why don't you, why don't you stay behind?
So blue. 
Why don't you, why don't you stay behind?
So blue 
Why don't you stop and look at what's down
