Lady, would you lay?
Lady, would you lay?
I'll rub them all away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely places all away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
I wanna rub your loneliness away
Last night I think I fell in love with you
It was from a window watching you around my way
I was too shy to even call to you
So I wrote some words that made it easier to say
Lady, would you lay?
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely places all away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
I wanna rub your loneliness away
Visions of you around my bed
Nothing but roses when you rest your lovely head
And I'll put my everything in you
You know I'm the only one who knows just what to do, lady
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely places all away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
I wanna rub your loneliness away
You've waited, oh so long for me to come your way
But now I'm here and sadness is gone away
Lay lady lay, lay, won't you lay with me?
Lady, would you lay?
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely places all away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
I wanna rub your loneliness away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely places all away
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
I wanna rub your loneliness away
All away
Hey hey, I wanna rub them all away
