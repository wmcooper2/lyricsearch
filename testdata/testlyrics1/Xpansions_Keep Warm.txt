Step left around and together with the rest
Now, here comes the music
Here comes the music

One, two, three, four

Are we getting funky

There she go
There she don't
You don't want to
You don't need to
Feel the warmth

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

One, two, three, four

Oh world
Keep on
Oh world
Keep on

One, two, three, four

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

Oh world
One, two, three, four

You don't need her

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm

One, two, three, four
