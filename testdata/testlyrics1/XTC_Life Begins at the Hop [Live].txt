I have learnt there's a magical spot at the hop
Come with me to the church on the corner, the hop
There's nuts and crisps and there's see-see-cola on tap
A good time had by those boys and those girls at the hop

Tell me what do you say?
(Tell me what do you say?)
Tell me what do you say?
I tell you, life begins at the hop, boys and girls

Prepare yourself for the boys in the band at the hop
The cheap guitars, they're too young for the bars at the hop
We'll jive around, make fools of ourselves, well then stop
We're back next week with another ridiculous tie knot

Tell me what do you say?
(Tell me what do you say?)
Tell me what do you say?
I tell you, life begins at the hop, boys and girls

Tell me what do you say?
(Tell me what do you say?)
Tell me what do you say?
(Tell me what do you say?)
I tell you, life begins at the hop, boys and girls
