Like a stranger in the night
You left me standing
I wonder where you are
Nothing else seem to matter
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
Did you ever see me weep ?
I'm so tired of it all

Like a cat in the dark
You left me restless
I wonder where you are
Nothing else seem to matter
I saw all my dreams fade and die
My tears blind my eyes
You can't say I didn't try
But I'm so tired of it all

You turned your back on me
Used me shamelessly
It's all a lie
It's all a lie
It's all a lie
It's all a lie
