Too good
Ain't it all too good?
Looks like Lady Luck is waking up on the right side
Doing just fine
Get along just fine
I keep waking up afraid to look on the bright side

I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous 'cause what comes up must come down
I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous 'cause what comes up must come down, ooh ooh ho ooh

Okay
Doing A-okay
I feel right as rain, and I can't complain, it's amazing
And I'm getting alright
There's not a cloud in sight
Lifts me off my feet, feels so sweet I can taste it

I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous 'cause what comes up must come down
I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous 'cause what comes up must come down, ooh ooh ho ooh

I get nervous (ooh ooh ho ooh)
I get nervous (ooh ooh ho ooh)
I get nervous 'cause what comes up must come down (ooh ooh ho ooh)

(I, I, I get) I get nervous
(I, I, I get) ah so nervous
(I, I, I get) I get nervous
(I, I, I get)

I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down
I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down, ooh ooh ho ooh

I get nervous (ooh ooh ho ooh)
I get nervous (ooh ooh ho ooh)
I get nervous 'cause what comes up must come down (ooh ooh ho ooh)
