Day to parade 
Your best shirt and boots
Nothing to lose
In Biroland

Get in a sandpan
We're going down river
Write down your name
Upon my arm

In indian ink
Indian
In indian ink
Indian
In indian ink
Indian

Down by docks
There are sailors
They don't mind a novice
To take under a wing

What do you take me for?

Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Never been
Wouldn't mind seeing

What do ya take me for?
What do ya?
What do ya?

Papa breathe through the fire
With a weeze and crank crank 
Weeze cough weeze 
And a crank crank weeze cough 

He thrusts his fists against the post
But still insists he sees the ghosts
I pat the dog
It understands
I make a move
Now just one hand

I got that
Mother hen feeling
Never been
Wouldn't mind seeing

What do ya take me for?

Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Never been
Wouldn't mind seeing

What do ya take me for?
What do ya?
What do ya?

I noticed on passing
That your flag was partly raised
I couldn't help but see it
Cause it's always in the way
Have you seen what he's done
He insists it's all in our interests
The love
I love 
The bad seeds have all been sown

Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Never been
Wouldn't mind seeing

What do ya take me for?
What do ya?
What do ya?

Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline
Never been
Wouldn't mind seeing
