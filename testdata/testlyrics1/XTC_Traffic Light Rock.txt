I'm out and I'm driving
Got my eyes set on romance
She says I've got a brand new thingey
Want to show you this dance
I say am I learning it steady
She say Look you're doing it already
It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go
All of the time
It's the traffic light rock
Stop 'n go - all of the time
I'm out by the dance hall
Best buddy by my side
He says I've got a brand new car
I want to take for a ride
I say can we take Joan and Freddie
He say no they ain't ready
