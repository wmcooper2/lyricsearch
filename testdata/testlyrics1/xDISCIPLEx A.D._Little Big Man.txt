Fly like an ego with th wind beneath your wings because the worlds got your back or so you think and you're right
On track cast out and sink little big man you stand so tall but in reality you're so small who's the next target
You got them in your sights with your finger on the trigger sacrifice to make you bigger who's got your back.
