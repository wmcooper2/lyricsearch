Watch them go one two three
I'm so happy and so is she
In a 'Danceband'
Show slow quick quick slow
Heel to hell and toe to toe
In a 'Danceband'
You can do the Bosanova
'Till the night is through
You know Gay Gordon
You can meet him too
But when you hear that tune
One and one makes two
Don't step on my toes
