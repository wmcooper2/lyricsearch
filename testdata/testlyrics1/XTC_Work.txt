Keep your fingers busy 
Mentally or physically 
What four-letter word 
D'you know like... 
Look at me smile 
Look at me doing their 
Work 
Why'see me shuffle in the dirt 
My how I sweat 
But I don't mind 
'Cause it's work 
You got me rolling up my shirt 
There's all my old friends 
Sat by the fountain drinking beer 
Their days have no starts and no ends 
They drift into pub nights with no 
Promise for tomorrow 
All that they want is some 
Work 
Work 
Look at me smile 
Look at me polish these tools 
Am I breaking all the rules? 
A cycle like that 
I don't want to be late for school 
Well it's night school 
Now all my new friends 
Sit in their [site] huts drinking tea 
My day has no start and no ends 
Drifts into whole nights in my 
Coffin by the fireside 
Bugger this game 
I know who's to blame 
And that's 
Work 
Aw, work 
Keep your fingers busy 
Mentally or physically 
What four-letter word 
D'you know like 
Oh! Work, work 
Oh! Work, work 
I'm back with my old friends 
Sat by the Brunel drinking beer 
Don't want this to ever end 
We're living in fear of being 
Mizzled by a new myth 
Work 
I don't want to go to work 
Work 
I don't want to go to work
