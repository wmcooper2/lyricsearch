Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man
Putting end to evil doers games
Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man
Maybe you are in his book of names 
Maybe you are in his book of names

Na, na, naw
Da, da, da na, na, na, naw

So be kind and helpful to your mother
Just think twice before you try to steal
When he cuts with sticky silver snippers
You may find the wounds'll never heal

All self made bad boys
If you refuse to believe he exist
You won't be frightened when you find out
You're on his list 
You're on his list
You're on his list

Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man
Putting end to evil doers games
Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man
Maybe you are in his book of names 
Maybe you are in his book of names

Na, na, naw
Da, da, da na, na, na, naw

So be good and never poison people 
Just think twice before the deed is done 
When you wake up guilty in the morning
You may find important pieces gone

All self made bad boys
If you refuse to believe he exist
You won't be frightened when you find out
You're on his list 
You're on his list
You're on his list

Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man
Putting end to evil doers games
Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man
Maybe you are in his book of names

All self made bad boys
If you refuse to believe he exist
You won't be frightened when you find out
You're on his list
