Heard the neighbor slam his car door 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 
What d'you think he bought that car for 
'Cause he realize this is respectable street 

Now they talk about absorption 
In cosmopolitan proportions to their daughters 
As they speak of child prevention 
And immaculate receptions on their portable 
Sony entertainment centers

Heard the neighbor slam his car door 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 
What d'you think he bought that car for 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 

Now she speaks about diseases 
And which proposition pleases best her old man 
Avon lady fills the creases 
When she manages to squeeze in past the caravans 
That never move from their front gardens

Heard the neighbor slam his car door 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 
What d'you think he bought that car for 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 

It's in the order of their hedgerows 
It's in the way their curtains open and close 
It's in the look they give you down their nose 
All part of decency's jigsaw I suppose 

Sunday church and they look fetching 
Saturday night saw him stretching over our fence 
Bang the wall for me to turn down 
I can see them with their stern frown 
As they dispense the kind of look that says 
They're perfect

Heard my neighbor slam his car door 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 
What d'you think he bought that car for 
Don't he realize this is respectable street 
He realize this is respectable street 
He realize this is respectable street 
He realize this is respectable street
