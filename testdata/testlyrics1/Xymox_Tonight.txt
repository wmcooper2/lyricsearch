EVERYTIME I LOOK AT YOU
I WONDER WHAT GOES ON
BEHIND YOUR HAPPY SMILE
IT'S SOMETHING REALLY STRONG

FULL MOON SWINGS AROUND
FULL MOON SWINGS AROUND
ON THIS SECRET NIGHT

TIME WILL FLY TONIGHT
TIME WILL DIE TONIGHT
TONIGHT

EVERYTIME YOU LOOK AT ME
I WONDER WHAT GOES ON
IF ONLY I COULD SWIM
IN THOSE DROWNING THOUGHTS

TONIGHT
LET'S ROLL DOWN THE STAIRS
SOON WE'LL FOLLOW EVERYONE
LET'S ROLL DOWN THE STAIRS
SOON EVERYBODY FOLLOWS EVERYONE

'CAUSE TIME FLIES ONLY WITH YOU
TIME DIES ONLY WITH YOU
TIME WILL FLY TONIGHT
TIME WILL DIE TONIGHT
TONIGHT
TIME DIES ONLY WITH YOU
ONLY WITH YOU
