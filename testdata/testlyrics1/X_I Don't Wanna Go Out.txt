I...don't wanna go out 
I...don't wanna stay in 
I'll sit inside my box and vandalize my dirty mind 

I...don't wanna go out 
I...don't wanna stay in 
I'll sit inside my room and vandalize my dirty mind 
I won't get any food but then I'll eat myself alive 

I...am bumming you out 
I...am doing you in 
This mess is running in and out of every part of me 
The less that I am wanting you, the more I want to see 
You got a silver bullet, at my heart you're aiming 
You're gonna shoot me down if I just start complaining 
You only want me when you got me pleading 
When you got me on my knees then you should stop my bleeding 

Do it, no don't ever make me do it 
There's hostility from everyone around, yeah 
Do it, no don't ever make me do it 
There's hostility from everyone around, yeah 

Do it, no don't ever make me do it 
There's hostility from everyone around, yeah 

Do it, no don't ever make me do it 
There's hostility from everyone around, yeah 

Do it, no don't ever make me do it 
There's hostility from everyone around, yeah
