This might be the last time
That I'll see your sweet smile
So please try not to cry
And please don't ask why

But you say
Don't go now
You say
Don't go now
You say
Stay some how
You say

This might be the last time
And I know that I
I need a long long while
To find a new shine, so fine

But you say
Don't go now
You say
Don't go now
You say
Stay some how

So define
