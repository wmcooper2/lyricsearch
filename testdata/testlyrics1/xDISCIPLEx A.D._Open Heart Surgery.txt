Laws soaked in blood will not change hearts of stone a heart so full of self has no room for the air of life throw down you arms they are no good to us now empty your bullets on the floor we fight a bloody war pull a part remove the cancer disintegration of the heart we fight a bloody war but we need to fight it on the right field fight fire with fire and we'll all be reduced to ashes a change of heart not a change of laws this world needs work on an open heart
