It's the airwaves of the world
Not the hairwaves on your head
Oh but anything can be
On land and in the sea
When you've got

Crosswires
When you've got crosswires
Everything is buzz buzz
Everything is beep beep

Strange things happen everyday
It's confusions the Chinese say
Brings a nation to its feet
It's them people that you meet
