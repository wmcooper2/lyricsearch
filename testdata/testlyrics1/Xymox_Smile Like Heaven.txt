YOU'RE SO YOUNG
AND I,
I GOT TO DO SOMETHING
WHEN YOU SWIRL YOUR FEET
YOUR HANDS UP HIGH
AND I GET SO CONFUSED
AND THE WORLD COMES
AND THE WORLD COMES
AND THE WORLD COMES
TUMBLING DOWN

SOMEDAY, WHEN THINGS ARE RIGHT
I'LL TAKE YOU UP AND SMILE
SOMEDAY WHEN THE SUN IS HIGH
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY

MY WORDS SEEM GREY, SO GREY
BY YOUR SWEEPING COLOURS SWIRLING DOWN
I KNOW THERE'RE SO FEW, I KNOW
WHO SMILE LIKE YOU DO

OH WILL YOU COME ALIVE
PICTURE ON THE WALL
OH WILL YOU COME TO ME
I'LL TAKE YOU ANYWHERE

OH WITH THIS SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
YOU SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
A SMILE IN HEAVEN
YOU SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
A SMILE IN HEAVEN

SOMEDAY, WHEN THINGS ARE RIGHT
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU UP AND SMILE
SOMEDAY, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
SOMEDAY

I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY

OH WILL YOU COME TO ME
PICTURE ON THE WALL
OH WILL YOU COME WITH ME
I'LL TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
YOU'RE SO YOUNG
LOOKING AT THE PICTURE
OH YOU'RE SO YOUNG

A SMILE IN HEAVEN
YOU SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
YOU SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
A SMILE IN HEAVEN

SOMEDAY, WHEN THINGS ARE RIGHT
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU UP AND SMILE
SOMEDAY, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
I'LL TAKE YOU ANYWHERE

SOMEDAY WHEN THE SUN IS HIGH
SOMEDAY I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
I'LL TAKE YOU ANYWHERE

YOU SMILE IN HEAVEN
YOU SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
SMILE LIKE HEAVEN
YOU SMILE IN HEAVEN
