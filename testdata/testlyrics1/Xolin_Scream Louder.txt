Tired of injustice, tired of the scheme
Life is disgustin' so what does it mean, Debbie
You kick to me down I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds the whole system sucks, Debbie

Peek in the shadow, I come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but ya I care about mine
I've got to get stronger and I won't give up the fight

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

Tired of tellin' the story your way
It's causin' confusion you think it's okay, Debbie
Keep changin' the rules while I playin' the game
I can't take it much longer I think I might go insane

With such confusions don't make me wanna scream, baby

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening, it's all injustice

Baby, with such illusions don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it, no

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
