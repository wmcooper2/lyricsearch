Can't you see 'em, in obscene procession? 
Clad in fox fur all cocky, they're violent and insane 
Pink and wobbling with all their possessions 
They live on junk food and TV and booze 
And bottles of pain relief pills and all
Don't you love them? 
They make life hell here 
And think there's heaven above 'em
Can't you hear 'em in obscene procession? 
It's called talking, it's how they betray their closest friends
Cough and wheezing, they dribble pretension
Slimy tongues tell the truth which they love to bash and bend
Can't you smell 'em in obscene procession? 
Stink of bacon, defoliants, [fear/beer] and [small cigars/swastikas] 
Whips and semen, adulterous confessions
Mixed with money and those little refreshments 
Hung in their cars and wardrobes and all 
Don't you hate 
Those full of hot air 
They need their warfare 
To deflate 'em
Animals beware 
Knives and forks that glare 
Never trust those staring humans 
Being the worst 
Especially when they're hungry
Animals beware 
Knives and forks so bare 
Never trust those staring humans 
Being the worst 
Especially when they're hungry 
They make each other hungry 
There's no need to be hungry 
Not today
Can't you see 'em, in obscene procession? 
Fat and pompous, they crush their only children to the floor 
Aren't you glad that I told you about them? 
Aren't you glad you never evolved up any more?
