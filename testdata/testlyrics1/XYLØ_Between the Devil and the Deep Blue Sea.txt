Another day shipwrecked
Can you hear my prayer?
If you have the answer let me know
Stolen from another life
You appeared in mine
It doesn't feel the same as it did before

And the tide it takes me away from you
And it brings me back again
And you slip like sand right through my hands
With every word you say

Oh, you'll find me, between
The devil and the deep blue sea
And I'm going under
Oh, you'll find me, between
The devil and the deep blue sea
And I'm going under

I'm coming up for air
Come and share my last breath
Save it for a time when I'm here no more
We're diving in the deep end
We can't turn back again
The battle never ends but you won the war

And the tide it takes me away from you
And it brings me back again
And you fall like water through my hands
With every word you say

Oh, you'll find me, between
The devil and the deep blue sea
And I'm going under
Oh, you'll find me, between
The devil and the deep blue sea
And I'm going under

(I'm drowning now)
(Come and save me, save me, oh)
I'm sinking like a stone
Never, never felt something like this before
And we're drowning, we need saving, so
This ended long ago
Never, never met someone like you before
And we're drowning, we need saving, so

You'll find me, between
The devil and the deep blue sea
And I'm going under
Oh, you'll find me, between
The devil and the deep blue sea
And I'm going under

I'm drowning now
Come and save me, save me, oh
