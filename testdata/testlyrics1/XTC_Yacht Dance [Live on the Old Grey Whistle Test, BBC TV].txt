We, we will dance like tiny boats with cotton sails
Upon the tops of the seas
That, that would pull us down to the depths and crush us flat
If given half a chance

No need to look back to pictures of lost, when all was rust
We, we will skim across the surface of the mud
As if we're spinning pebbles

In our yacht dance
In our yacht dance

We, we will dance like tiny boats with cotton sails
Upon the tops of the seas
Made, made of people stained with scorn
Who never see the light of real love

No need to look back through diaries of lost now turned to dust
We, we will skate across the surface of the storm
As if we're wheeling sea-birds

In our yacht dance
In our yacht dance

And how they'll be jealous of both of us
In our yacht dance

We, we will dance like tiny boats with cotton sails
Upon the tops of the seas
Made of people stained with scorn who never see the light of real love

In our yacht dance
In our yacht dance
