Two people take a vow to be together
And live and love each other forever.
They promise to love a lifetime
Funny thing
Then they change their minds.
They both go their seperate ways
And love is just a memory.
But a young heart doesn't stay sad long
Another love soon comes along.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

Two people don't get along
Deep down in both have feelings very strong
They try hard to conceal it.
Their hearts burn 'cause they both know they can feel it.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

Lovers leave without a reason
Feelings change just like seasons.
In love nothing's for certain
There's no use in pretending what's behind the curtain.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

And sometimes it's so unfair
when the feeling's no longer there.

That's the way love is

And sometimes it's gratifying
Love's feeling just ain't no denying.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

It's just the way love is
