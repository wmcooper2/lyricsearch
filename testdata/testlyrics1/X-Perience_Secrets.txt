Wake me up, I'm dreaming
I want you to know
It?s dangerous
To know everything
About my dreams
I want you to know
I want you to know
It?s dangerous
Hold me when I'm falling
I'm falling in love with a princess
The kind of the dreams
Tries to catch me
I'm running away
I try to escape
Into the next day
I tell all the secrets
I try to keep
When I'm dreaming
When I talk in my sleeps
The kind of dreams and nightmares
Will hold me in his arms tonight
But he's just a fool
He can't catch my soul
He can't kill my soul
Wake me up, I'm dreaming
I try to escape, it?s dangerous
To be in my world
Of dreams and nightmares
I'm running away
I try to escape
Into the next day
