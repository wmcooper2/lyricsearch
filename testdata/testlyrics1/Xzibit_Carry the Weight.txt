Intro: Xzibit, [J-Ro] 

I really wish I could you know at twenty-one 
youknowhatI'msayin',he he, yo yo 
[I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things 
I do, youknowhatI'm sayin'] 
Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin' 
Go ahead 
Yeah! I break it down like this 

Verse One: 

You see I don't like to remenisce about the past 
The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth 
Each and every wrong move the police keep count 
make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out 
I was at the funeral when it all began 
You know the painful transition from a boy to men 
I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine 
didn't understand death nearly lost my mind 
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it 
Age ten, new step family arrangement 
at thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick 
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit 
I would forever be hit with anything in reach 
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach 
about forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked 
Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked 
physical contact was in form of a slap 
at the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back 
courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap 
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black 
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate 
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate 
I don't remember the date of the judicial debate 
but legally I was now in custody of the state 

Chorus: 

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink 
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak 
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make 
Gotta find some way to release this hate 

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink 
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak 
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make 
Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight 

Interlude: Xzibit, [J-Ro] 

[Yeah it's fucked up though man] 
[YouknowhatI'msayin'] 
Yo 
[The fuck you doin' in jail] 
Insane man, I don't know man, he he he 
[Yeah wats goin' on down there, gotta get out dude] 
Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man 
YouknowI'msayin' 
[It's popin' man] 
It's cool yo fuck that 
[It's popin' out here] 
They can go on and on for that 
[I'm tellin' you it's popin' man come home] 

Verse Two: 

And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home 
but only now I was fucked up plus all alone 
My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone 
Turned age sixteen now on my own 
Started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too 
with no hesitation lock load then blast you 
Without a hastle we in a town of hicks 
fuckin' all these chicks 
Sellin' rock by the bricks 
so we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown 
At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down 
Screamin' demands "Let me see your goddamn hands (now)" 
A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban 
we never kept it in the house 
So of course we clounded 
Only found one pistol took us all down town 
We be out by the end of the afternoon 
gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM! 
Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife 
Ty and Matt caught bodies 
Now they spend there life behind bars 
catchin' scars that will not heal 
niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real 

Chorus 1 1/2 

outro: 

Like this 
Like this, like that 
Yeah! gotta carry the weight 
Like this euh! 
Bringin live 
Yeah! yeah! like this 
It's Xzibit 
Gotta carry the weight 
Like that yo! 
Like that yo!
