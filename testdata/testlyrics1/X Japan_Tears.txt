何処に行けばいい 貴方と離れて
今は過ぎ去った 時流に問い掛けて
長すぎた夜に 旅立ちを夢見た
異国の空見つめて
孤独を抱きしめた
流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
終わらない貴方の 吐息を感じて
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love

Loneliness your silent whisper
Fills a river of tears
Through the night
Memory you never let me cry
And you, you never said good-bye
Sometimes our tears
Blinded the love
We lost our dreams along the way
But I never thought
You'd trade your
Soul to the fates
Never thought
You'd leave me alone
Time through the rain
Has set me free
Sands of time will
Keep your memory
Love everlasting fades away
Alive within your beatless heart
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love

流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
終わらない悲しみを
青い薔薇に変えて
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
終わらない貴方の 吐息を感じて
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love

If you could have told me
Everything
You would have found
What love is
If you could have told me
What was on your mind
I would have shown you the way
Someday
I'm gonna be older than you
I've never thought
Beyond that time
I've never imagined
The pictures of that life
For now
I will try to live for you
And for me
I will try to live with love,
Try to live with love,
With dreams,
And forever with tears
