It's come to our attention
Life now is bound to change
While we the peaceful majority
We sit back and anticipate

These are our days now
These are not the same now
These are not the same
These human beings are dangerous
Their greed is contagious
Now the world it waits

These people they attacked our freedom
Their weapons technology and hate
Lives were stolen without warning
Brothers and sisters now erased

- Chorus -
These are our days now
These are not the same now
These are not the same
These human beings are dangerous
Their greed is contagious
Now the world it waits

- Chorus again -
