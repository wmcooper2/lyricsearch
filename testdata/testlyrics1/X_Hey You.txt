Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised

[Chorus]
Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about
Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about
Hey you! hey you! hey you!
Hey you what's this now
Going down going down
Are you sorry now
Going down going down 
What's your story now
Going down, why do you want to die

Black tar in your veins
Once new, now stained

[Chorus]

Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised
Hey you
