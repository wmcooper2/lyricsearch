When the day is young,
And the laughs are thin
I stayed the night too long
And the colour grows upon my skin

Shame, shame, shame
All I feel is
Shame, shame, shame
All I feel is
Shame, shame, shame
All I feel is
Shame, shame, shame

Just pack and go and never return
When will I ever learn?
When will I ever learn?
Not to turn and stare
Not to turn and stare

Shame, shame, shame
All I feel is
Shame, shame, shame
All I feel is
Shame, shame, shame
All I feel is
Shame, shame, shame
