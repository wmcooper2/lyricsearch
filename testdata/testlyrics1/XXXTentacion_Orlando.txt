The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Waiting til' my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck and the hole in my back, again
I be waiting on death with a smile on my face
This is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Face my fears
Loving her for what I have
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Spinning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
At all
