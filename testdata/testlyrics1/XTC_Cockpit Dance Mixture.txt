Man acting like a farmer, 
And he's treating the woman like a poor cow. 
He got to treat you better from now. 
But man is just a baby, 
And he's needing your milk of kindness I vow, 
To drink as much as you will allow. 
All the way through history, 
Man machine, no mystery. 
All the way through history, 
Girl have the brain to act just like the weaker sex. 
Down in the cockpit, 
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it. 
Down in the cockpit, 
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it. 
Queen wants the castle back from the rascal 
Queen wants the castle 
Now! 
The girl tribe are growing up, 
And filling the world full with a new soul, 
To get so far they paid a high toll. 
Try not to make, 
The same mistakes, 
As man has made or you'll fall in that hole, 
And you will see us changing our role. 
Oh! Look what is this creature down in that hole? 
Some say they were called men.
