Officer blue
Really love the things you do
Even when I was just eight years old
(Eight years old)

Officer blue
Is it true what they say?
That when you work you're still at play
(Still at play)

Oh, officer blue
I really love the things you do
It's magical, people in a human zoo

Officer blue
Cast a shadow on the wall
But by torchlight even mice look tall
(They don't fall)

Officer blue
In a blaze of human form
And your stripes and badges to conform
(You conform)

Officer blue
Really love the things you do
Even when I was just eight years old
(Eight years old)

Officer blue
Is it true what they say?
That when you work you're still at play
(Still you play)
