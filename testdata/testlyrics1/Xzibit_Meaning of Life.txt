[Chorus]
So what's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I don't know, I don't know
All I know is when I grab the microphone and let me up on this stage
Grand arsony cause I'm still in the show
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

Let me tell you about this bitch ass half cock pussy ass niggas
It's never gonna pull the trigger to protect no figures
Never seen a hard time in your life beating the shit out of your kids and your wife
Because what you lack in a fight
That we all fight similar self aided mutilation
Never lost angel Los Angeles congratulations
From admiration to aggravation to the highest level
Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart cold and in gut metal I didn't survive at all
Praying for my downfall got the fuck from around y'all
Know when niggas bringing me down even include myself
I celebrate life for nobody else
Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health
Memento tried in stealth
Explain Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fail for the dollar
Now watch Xzibit rise to power
I turn these fifteen minutes to hours
But still ask

[Chorus]

Let me tell why you these hypocrites and half wits
Caught up into politics
Worked yourself to death but uncle Sammy is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology surveillance's a bitch
And everyone one of us some of us got no heart or no back bone
The few will see freedom while most of the masses will conform
The woman you lust for is usually not the one to stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for em attacking the land lords
'Cause the shit too high we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die may it not be in vain more
Importantly more to see keep it cracking orderly
Got my future in front of me focus is fucking phenomenal
Nobody can touch us I turn the impossible possible with it
Do me a favor man do not try to tell me shit
It's just me and my bitch

[Chorus]

When I was injured I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears my nose and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children
That was alot of my motivation because I knew the way that they were looking at me
I had to get stronger I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard

Let me tell you about these long days of sleepless nights
Penny pension trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on into your destiny and set the stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live out loud make it no regrets
This for the set this for the ones that never waken up
Living a fantasy insanity is fake as fuck
They out of touch they out of line it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains misery eventually found the fountain of youth
It's been pissed in, shit in violated till they pollute
That's why they shoot have your ass in a box dressed in a suit
'Bout time you got in touch with your roots

[Chorus]

The best help that you can do is help yourself
You gotta step up you gotta find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it because you know you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in the road
Yeah you're gonna be stuck in that bad place it's depressing
And holding you back
The only person that can set you free is yourself
