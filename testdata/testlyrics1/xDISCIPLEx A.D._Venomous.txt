Declare communicate I must admit that my life is better without the tongue of death immunity futility
My body breaks like the next man waiting in line to die these words steal cheat lie this hearth burns
Breaks dies the worst inside of us the beast instinct to destroy at who lashes back I will not walk that path
This world burns breaks dies.
