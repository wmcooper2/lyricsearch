Mother's in the kitchen steaming up the window panes 
Smell of boiling cabbage comes up from an open drain 
But no amount of scrubbing could ever shift a gravy stain 

Washaway washaway washerette 
Washaway washaway every dirty stain you get 

Streets lay deserted 
No one feels exerted 
Sat on their couches 
With loose change in their pouches 
They couldn't spend it if they tried 

In comes Mr Softee 
Dressed up like an ice cream cone 
Ringing for his supper 
Heading for a stately home 
But a thousand Yorkshire puddings 
Couldn't make his business boom 

See how they wander 
To kill time in droves they squander 
Money in centres 
That feed on the mind, oh bother 
It just gets you down 

Washaway washaway washerette 
Business as usual at the uptown launderette 

Washaway washaway the dirt 
Wash it 
Washaway the dirt
