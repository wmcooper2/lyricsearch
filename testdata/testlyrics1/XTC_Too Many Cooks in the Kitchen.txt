There's too many cooks in the kitchen
There's too many minds on the job
There's too many cooks in the kitchen
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Cooking the books and getting their fractions wrong
What we need is law and order
Everybody knows
Can't have chiefs without the injuns
Stepping on their toes
There's too many cooks in the kitchen
There's too many daps in the pie
There's too many cooks in the kitchen
Everybody needs a place in the rat race
Playing games of power, it's only a cat chase
Too many too many too many etc.
Too many cooks in the kitchen
