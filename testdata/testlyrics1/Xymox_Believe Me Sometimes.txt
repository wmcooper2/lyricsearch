Should I give you words
And if you don't believe them
Should I care
Oh all these times

We fight without a reason
I must be blind
To believe you
Believe me sometimes...

I could be a saint to you
And I could play a heroine for you
I could be a lover to you, should I?
'Cause I might just fall for you

To choose to fight for love and love to fight
Is to get as much as you lose, sister
I hate to see you go
I hate the way you're slipping back

To a life you never wanted
I wish somehow
I could leave you something
Leave me something

Something more
Oh I could be a saint to you
And I could play a heroine for you
I could be a lover to you, should I?

'Cause I might just fall for you
Should I believe you
Should I believe you
Should I?

'Cause I might just fall for you
Oh I could be a saint for you
And I could play a heroine for you
Should I believe you

Should I believe you
Should I?
'Cause I might just fall for you
