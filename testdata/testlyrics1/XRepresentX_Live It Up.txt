To you it's just the same old story,
nothing in your mind has changed.
Your sustained affinity for suicide,
makes me question your sense of reality.
After all the textbook cases,
the tried and true stories of, not life, but death,
you continue to use yourself up,
with no intentions of stopping until theres nothing left.

Who has to die for you to change your path?
What do you have to lose for you to contemplate your life?
Take a look at it now, because death is so final,
and it doesnt leave much room for alterations.

I dont mean that my life's the only way to live,
but sometimes you dont seem worthy of the word alive.
