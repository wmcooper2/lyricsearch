(Welcome to L.A)
Where you can see the whole city burning
'Cause the cops got Uzis and the dealers keep serving
And your kids ain't learning shit, except this
Sex power and wealth, fuck everything else

(Welcome to L.A)
Where you can see the whole city burning
'Cause the cops got Uzis and the dealers keep serving
And your kids ain't learning shit, except this
Trying to survive, Los Angeles Times (Welcome to L.A)

Mc's get fucked up, chopped like Braveheart
Don't start what you can't finish, serious business
Down La Cienega to bust a left on Venice
Where you can find me and mine Los Angeles Times (Welcome to L.A)
Where every other day I'm taking the hat off my head
Givin' respect to the dead
And avoid havin' the same thing said about me
Xzibit stand underground like the roots of a tree
Watered three times a day forty ounce Olde E
Like a magnifying glass making it easier to see
The Mister X to the Z don't P
L.A., why test without vest-es
Stop lead projectile, Apocalypse Now
Love Allah not new car, faggot, superstar
Type of cat, fuck that
Mash away in a Diamond-white Concours 'Llac
Still black so the one-time react as if under attack
Ain't nothin changed but district range, feel no pain
Mr. Big Bad Insane Black John McClane with
Liquor on the brain, down to earth like dirt
From the city where niggas known for puttin' in work

If hand determine dick size, I'm palmin' the Earth
Select turf, then plant bad seed and give birth
And make the hard work look easy fuh sheezee
Leavin' you and your best man, stiffer than mannequins
Enough to break the skin on a Vietnam leatherneck
Marine drill sergeant, you nothin' but a target (pow!)
Charge it to the game, gotta look beyond the brand name
Comin' from the guts like I slammed down
Twenty cups of Hennessy straight relate feel my hate
Xzibit flippin' through these bitches like DJ trait
Translate to left field, only real niggas follow
Bitches suck and swallow, I'm livin' life behind the bottle
Never the role model, still shinin' like a new automobile
Flow six-fo', you can't steal
'Cause I got a kill switch with a itch for the action
While other rappers use mass weapons of destruction (Welcome to L.A)
To sell they shit

Where you can see the whole city burning
'Cause the cops got Uzis and the dealers keep serving
And your kids ain't learning shit, except this
Sex power and wealth, fuck everything else

El veterano, you can only pray to learn what I know
Ride slow across the horizon a lone desperado
Comin' through the door bringin' nothin' but hits
Sometimes I feel like a matador, lookin at this bullshit
Niggas pull rent from the crack of they ass
Maintain do your thang this too shall pass
I season beef with lead pieces then cook it with gas
I'm from the school of hard knocks way ahead in the class
Xzibit hard to get through, like bulletproof glass
Break it down like Johnny Cochran then mix it with hash
Your defense can't last against advanced prosecution
Hit the airwaves like pollution, hey, here's a solution
Take a trip to Washington then burn the constitution
Top government officials locked down for prostitution
Recruitin the hard rocks mean streets keep producin
The world is a riot shit is mine for the lootin'
