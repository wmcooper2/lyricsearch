Let's make a den
What shall we use?
Make it out of hay
Who will be leader?
In it we can play at both being mothers and fathers until we have
Children of our own.

Let's make a den
What shall we use?
Make it out of wood
Who will be leader?
Wouldn't it be good if we could fight off rival gangs and take total
Possession of the hill
For the rest of our days?

Isn't that what we can all look forward to when we grow up?
Isn't that what we can all look forward to?
Behind the door, women and men
Love and war inside of our den.

Let's make a den
What shall we use?
Make it out of bricks
Who will be leader?
In it how the sticks and stones will fly but my oh my won't we have
Fun when later on we patch it up?

Let's make a den
What shall we use?
Make it from cement
Who will be leader?
In it we can pent up all of our fears but give presents each Christmas
Like there was nothing ever wrong
For the rest of our days.

Isn't that what we can all look forward to when we grow up?
Isn't that what we can all look forward to?
Behind the door, women and men
Love and war inside of their den.

Well you can wear your brand new nurse's outfit,
And I can wear my brand new cowboy suit.
Everything unchanging
Just furniture arranging

Let's make a den
What shall we use?
Make it underground
Who will be leader?
Protect us from the flash and sound of the big stick they drop just
To stop us from cuddling and hanging on
For the rest of our days.
