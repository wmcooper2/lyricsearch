SHE IS BENEDICTION - SHE IS ADDICTED TO THEE
SHE IS THE ROOT CONNECTION - SHE IS CONNECTING WITH THEE

SHE IS SUBLIMATION - SHE IS THE ESSENCE OF THEE
SHE IS CONCENTRATING ON HE , CHOSEN SHE

I'M DANCING BAREFOOT, HEADING FOR A SPIN
SOME STRANGE MUSIC DRAWS ME IN
MAKES ME COME ON LIKE SOME HEROINE

SHE IS RECREATION - SHE'S INTOXICATED BY THEE
SHE HAS THE SLOW SENSATION THAT HE IS LEVITATING WITH SHE

HERE I GO, WELL I DON'T KNOW WHY
I FLOAT SO CEASELESSLY
COULD IT BE HE'S TAKEN OVER ME

I'M DANCING BAREFOOT, IN MID-AIR I SPIN
SOME STRANGE MUSIC DRAWS ME IN
MAKES ME COME ON LIKE SOME HEROINE

I'M DANCING BAREFOOT, HEADING FOR A SPIN
SOME STRANGE MUSIC DRAWS ME IN
MAKES ME COME ON LIKE SOME HEROINE
