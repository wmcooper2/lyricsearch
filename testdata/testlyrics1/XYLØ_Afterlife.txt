I'm bad luck baby, you know
Follows me around everywhere I go
And I don't need your sympathy, no
I need a fuckin' miracle, oh
Red wine teeth stain, it's been a long day
I just want your love, not your money
Leave me here, I'll be fine
I'll wait for the stars to align

'Cause oh, how the other half live
With their perfect skin
And oh, how I'll never be, never be
Just like them, so

I, I, I'm waiting for the afterlife
To show me a good time, baby
Somebody save me, I just wanna be loved
I, I, I'm waiting for the afterlife
To show me a good time, baby
Somebody save me, I just wanna be loved

Don't watch TV no more
The news fuckin' scares me, new world war
And I don't wanna run away, no
I need a fuckin' holiday
So bad blood bankrupt out of love and luck
I'll get the keys to your Murci√©lago
Another drink will see me through
Feeling invincible

So oh, how the other half live
With their perfect teeth
And oh, how I'll never be, never be
Just like them, so

I, I, I'm waiting for the afterlife
To show me a good time, baby
Somebody save me, I just wanna be loved
I, I, I'm waiting for the afterlife
To show me a good time, baby
Somebody save me, I just wanna be loved

We're still young, but we got older
We don't believe everything that we're told, yeah
We just wanna love, we just wanna be loved
We're still young, but we got older
We don't believe everything that we're told, yeah
We just wanna love, we just wanna be loved

So I, I, I'm waiting for the afterlife
To show me a good time, baby
Somebody save me, I just wanna be loved
I, I, I'm waiting for the afterlife
To show me a good time, baby
Somebody save me, I just wanna be loved
