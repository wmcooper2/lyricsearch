You've learnt no lessons 
All that time so cheaply spent 
There's no youth culture 
Only masks they let you rent 

Travels, travels in Nihilon 
We've seen, no Jesus come and gone 

Fashion, their vampire 
Drapes itself across your back 
As you fall from style 
It waits rebirth on its rack 

Building your whimsy 
Hypnotising you to need 
Dance goes full circle 
One step ahead of your greed 

You've learnt no lessons 
All those years to get it right 
Flashes of promise 
Burn out faster than strobe light
