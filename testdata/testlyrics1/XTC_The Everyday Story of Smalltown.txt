Smalltown, snoring under blankets 
Woken by the clank 
It's just the milkman's dawn round 
Smalltown, hiding undercovers 
The lodgers and the lovers 
Are asleep 'round Smalltown 

Shiney grey black snake of bikes 
He slithers 
Bearing up the men and boys 
To work 
We're standing in poplar lines 
Making alarm clocks that'll wake our wives up 
Don't ask us, we haven't the time 
We're racing the hooter that'll signal life's up 

Smalltown, crouching in the valley 
Woken by the Sally Army 
Sunday marchround 
Smalltown, coughing in the toilet 
Who on earth would spoil it 
Would they pull down Smalltown? 

If it's all the same to you 
Mrs Progress 
Think I'll drink my Oxo up 
And get away 
It's not that you're repulsive to see 
In your brand new catalogue nylon nightie 
You're too fast for little old me 
Next you'll be telling me it's 1990 

I have lived here for a thousand years or maybe more 
And I've sheltered all the children who have fought the wars 
And as payment they make love in me 
In squeaky beds 
In bicycle sheds 
Inside of their heads 
As singles and weds 
As Tories and Reds 
And that's how I'm fed 
And that's how I'm fed 

Smalltown, snoring under blankets 
Woken by the clank 
It's just the milkman's dawn round 
Smalltown, hiding undercovers 
The lodgers and the lovers 
Are asleep 'round Smalltown 

Smalltown, crouching in the valley 
Woken by the Sally Army 
Sunday marchround 
Smalltown, coughing in the toilet 
Now who on earth would spoil it 
Will you pull down Smalltown 

Smalltown 
Smalltown
