Watch them go one two three
I'm so happy and so is she
In a dance band

Show, slow, quick, quick, slow
Heel to hell and toe to toe
In a dance band

Oh, you can do the Bosanova
Till the night is through
You know Gay Gordon
You can meet him too

But when you hear that tune
One and one makes two
Don't step on my toes
Don't step on my toes

Let's go

Watch them go one two three
I'm so happy and so is she
In a dance band

Show, slow, quick, quick, slow
Heel to hell and toe to toe
In a dance band

Oh, you can do the Bosanova
Till the night is through
You know Gay Gordon
You can meet him too

But when you hear that tune
One and one makes two
Don't step on my toes
Don't step on my toes

You can do the Bosanova
Till the night is through
You know Gay Gordon
You can meet him too

But when you hear that tune
One and one makes two
Don't step on my toes
Don't step on my toes

I'm in a dance band
I like a dance band
I'm in a dance band
I like a dance band

Show, slow, quick, quick, slow
Show, slow, quick, quick, slow
Show, slow, quick, quick, slow
Show, slow, quick, quick, slow
Quick, quick
