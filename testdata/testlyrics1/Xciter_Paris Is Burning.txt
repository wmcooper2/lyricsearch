This town I'm in can't take no more
Decadence is silly
You were my woman
Why'd you have to be so hard and cold

Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Paris is burning
Want to get to where you are

My life's in ruin
The girl I love
She's far away
The distant fire
Brings memories of the love
That I once knew
Where are you now
Been looking all around
And I can't stay
Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away

Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Paris is burning
Get back where you are

I can't believe
You'd throw it all away
You know you played me for a fool
I'm leavin' now
This time you know
That I'll be gone for good, yeah

Paris is burning, Paris
Paris is burning
Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Paris is burning
Paris
