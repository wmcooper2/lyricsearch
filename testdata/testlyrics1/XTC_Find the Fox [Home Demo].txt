The hunt is on to find the fox
Cross patchwork fields and spiny copse
Much to and froing
White horses showing
Their pearly teeth

He lead them up into a wood
Where he escape
I guess he should
You know he's a late starter
But he's much smarter
Than the rest

He lead them up a garden path
Such craftiness
You got to laugh
They got a clue man
He's almost human
Fox on the loose

You must see him showing if you run boy run boy
You must see him showing so be ready with your gun
You never see the going if you take the wrong side
You never see the going in the early morning sun
The hunt is on to find the fox
