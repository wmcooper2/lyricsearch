Towers of London 
when they had built you 
did you watch over the men who fell 
Towers of London 
when they had built you 
Victoria's gem found in somebody's hell 

Pavements of gold leading to the underground 
Grenadier Guardsmen walking pretty ladies around 
fog is the sweat of the never never navvies who pound 
spikes in the rails to their very own heaven 

Bridges of muscles spanning so long and high 
merchants from Stepney walking pretty ladies by 
rain is the tears of the never never navvies who cry 
for the bridge that doesn't go 
in the direction of Dublin 

And I've seen it in a painting 
and I've seen it in engraving 
and I've seen it in their faces 
clear as children's chalk lines on the paving 

Towers of London 
la la Londinium.
