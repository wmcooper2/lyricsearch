I have to leave and take my coat
It seems I'm kept in writing mode
With a lot of riddles to decode
Life's a long and winding
Life's a long and winding road

Just the right weather for light levitation
Life in motion not in portion
And I can hear me say “I think the war's on” for so long

Life's a long and winding
Life's a long and winding road
