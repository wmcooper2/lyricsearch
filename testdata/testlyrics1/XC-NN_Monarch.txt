[I'm just saying everybody is people, except me; 
I'm the Monarch]

The wall is high 
There is a moat
And for my sins
They gave me a boat
I'm in the water
The sails are full
Drawbridge down
I have no rope
[Be not part of the accident]

You name it
I've done it
Don't go out
Don't go to bars
Check your pockets
It's probably in there
Don't be a part of the accident
I am the Monarch
I am the King

The wall is high [That's a mirage]
There is a moat
And for my sins [That's a mirage]
They gave me a boat
There I sit 
Badly coked
Eyeballs slit [That's a mirage]
I choke
Not quite bedridden
But just about ill
[Be not part of the accident]

You name it
I've done it
Don't go out
Don't go to bars
Check your pockets
It's probably in there
Don't be a part of the accident
I am the Monarch
I am the King

[You got a run, aborigine, original father
With passion, emotion, reason and intent
In order to run you got to cook
In order to cook you got to have a fire
In order to have a fire you got to belong
I'm just saying everybody is people, except me; 
I'm the Monarch]

You name it
I've done it
Don't go out
Don't go to bars
Check your pockets
It's probably in there
Don't be a part of the accident
I am the Monarch
I am the King
