Jane says, "I'm done with Sergio"
He treats me like a ragdoll"
She hides the television
Says, "I don't owe him nothing, but if he comes back again
Tell him to wait right here for me or, 
Try again tomorrow I'm gonna kick tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow"
Jane says "have you seen my wig around"
"I feel naked without it"
She knows they all want her to go
That's okay man she don't like them anyway
Jane says, "I'm going away to Spain
When I get my money saved
I'm gonna start tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow"
She gets mad and she starts to cry
Takes a swing but she can't hit!
She don't mean to harm
She just don't know what else to do about it
Jane goes to the store at eight
She walks up on St. Andrews
She waits and gets her dinner there
She pulls her dinner from her pocket
Jane says, "I've never been in love"
No, she don't know what it is
She only knows if someone wants her
"I want 'em if they want me
I only know they want me"
Jane says. . .Jane says. . .
