I've met the strangers at a place
More than a million miles away
They were so nice, so full of grace
I know they came from far away
Now I'm walking on magic fields
I see the world is the only place to be
They took me to a foreign place
And then they thougt me to be strong
They told me not to go away
Even if anything goes wrong
I love the world I wouldn't leave
All the places we were born
I wait at midnight to receive
A final sign of their return
