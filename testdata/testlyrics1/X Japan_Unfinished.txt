Oh! I'm looking at you
Can't control myself
Nothing but pain for me

Wipe your tears from your eyes
Just leave and forget me
No need to be hurt anymore
Go away from me now
I don't know What is love?
No need to be hurt anymore
You said “I miss you so much”
“Everynight thinking of you
and facing loneliness”
But when you feel sadness
never can I stay with you
I'm not the one you need
Close your eyes and forget me
There's nothing
I can do anymore
I lost my way

I've been walking
in the night of tears
There I found
someone was holding you
As the night was
all falling down
With my love also vanished
my vision of you

My heart is cold now
Wipe your tears from your eyes
Just leave and forget me
No need to be hurt anymore
You said, “I need you always.”
“Everyday thinking of you
and living loneliness.”
But when you feel sadness
never can I stay with you
Go away from me now
I don't know What is love?
No need to be hurt anymore
Can't find my way
