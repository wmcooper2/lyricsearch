Let's bring some reality to it,
And the whole gang's in here, yeah, bitch (bitch)

OK, EST for life, 40 motherfuckin' days
I hustled, 40 nights
I got 40 deep behind me, ain't a motherfuckin' nice
40 swishas, 40 bitches, went from motherfuckin' rice

Shut it down, EST we shut it down
All them bitches know what's up, EST we run it now
And if you think that I'm lying, better go ask somebody
I'm just one out of a million, laced up, tatted, ridin' shawty

[Chorus]
OK now all I know is this hustle
All I want is that cream
If you ain't riding then fuck you
All I gots my team
Screaming EST (what the fuck)
EST (what the fuck)
EST (what the fuck)
EST (what the fuck)
OK I do it all for my city
All I know's these streets
Throw it up if you with me
And until I rest in peace!
I'm screaming EST (what the fuck)
EST (what the fuck)
EST (what the fuck)
EST (what the fuck)

OK, OK, I see they hide when we come 'round get the fuck down
I am from the city where they bow, love that gun sound
I am from the city where they ride 'til the sun down
Where they die by this tattoo, I rep nine so whats up now?

Its that reckless generation, EST my nation
Motherfuck your time you taking, you know Cleveland's my location,
Straight shots with no chasing, fuck 'em all in they faces,
They were sleeping on that shit I spit so I hawk spit in their faces

I cant take it, everybody better get in their places,
Me and all of mine are looking like gorillas
We fitted in all black you would think we racist,
Light it up like its Vegas, shuttin' down all that fake shit,
And not a damn one of these haters show they faces they like Craigslist

Must let it be known
If you pullin' up in my city you better holla 'daddy I'm home'
Yeah, we hustle like no other
No love and no supper 19 double X forever

[Chorus]

These mothafuckas don't know what the fuck going on
Its EST for life know what I'm sayin'
We gon' ride together get high together and best believe we gon' die together
I go by the name of DJ Xplosive and I'm stayin' for this shit
Aye Kells, Dubo, Slim G fuck these hatin' ass niggas
Either they run wit us or they run from us
Let me know put them L's up lace the fuck up
