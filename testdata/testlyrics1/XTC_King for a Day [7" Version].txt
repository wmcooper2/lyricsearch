Everyone's creeping up to the money god,
Putting tongues where they didnt ought to be.
On stepping stones of human hearts and souls,
Into the land of nothing for free.

Well the way that were living,
Is all take and no giving,
Theres nothing to believe in,
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way,
To be king for a day.

Everyone's licking up to the new king pin,
Trying to get way up with a smile.
Sing for your supper boy and jump to a finger click,
Aint my way of living in style.

cause the ladder gets longer,
And ambition gets stronger,
I cant satisfy the hunger,
That bad old moon has got you in its sway,
To be king for a day.

Youre only here once so you got to get it right.
(no time to fuss and fight.)
cause life dont mean much if measured out with someone elses plight.
(in time youll see the light.)

cause the way that were living,
Is all take and no giving,
Theres nothing to believe in,
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way,
To be king for a day.
