You and me we're going to party
All the way tonight
Find a spot right on the dance floor
Let your body fly

I'm just looking for romance
Now let your heart decide
Don't you know that? forever
On the floor tonight

Follow me to the dance floor
I got what you need and more
You know I got a body to die for
So baby what you waiting for?

Why don't you go on and call me
When you're home tonight
If you feel that you want me then
Don't let me down tonight

I'm just lookin' for romance
Now let your heart decide
Don't you know that? forever
On the floor tonight

Follow me to the dance floor
I got what you need and more
You know I got a body to die for
So baby what you waiting for?
