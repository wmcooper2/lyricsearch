Come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil

You shadow of forgotten dreams
You come to take away
My hope on your black wings

Come and come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still left lonely

Of love & hate the singers tell
But I feel more, more of both,
More than heaven & hell
I take a bow to destiny
Now I have really learnt my part
Once loving him, now hating love
I've made mistakes, my Ravenheart

So come and come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still left lonely

Will I get back who I adore?
Thus spoke the raven: nevermore

So come and come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still left lonely

Come to me [come to me], Ravenheart [Ravenheart]
Messenger of evil [Messenger of evil]
Come to me [come to me]. What's the news? [What's the news?]
Here I'm still left lonely
