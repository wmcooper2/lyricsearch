She feels my frozen touch
She didn't say too much
I know how you feel
I know what you think
We share our history
We killed our mystery
The words we speak
The games we play

I need a change from what I know
I lost my way long time ago
You knew it in your heart
You knew it from the start
It had to end this way
I can't bear a single day

Time stands still, today seems a year
Hand of faith, your time has come
All love turns to dust
The torch always rusts
Sure, we'll be friends
Words, drifting on words

I need a change from what I know
I lost my way long time ago
You knew it from the start
You knew it in your heart
It had to end this way
I can't bear a single day

It had to happen
It had to happen this way
