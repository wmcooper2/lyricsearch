Across a crowded room 
I first set eyes on you 
My vision was impaired 
Obstructed out of view 

By those - faces in a crowded room 
Them - bodies in a crowded room 
Their - breathing in a crowded room 
And they're - pushing me out 
Down the fire escape 

In the crowded room I won't touch too much 
I felt the punch of a punch 
The language was enough 
To send me running etc.
