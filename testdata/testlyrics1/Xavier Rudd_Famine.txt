Well, I wake up early one morning
And I went down to Spanish Town
To look for a friend of mine
Who's called Seminaya

Then we started to have a little talk
About everything
About the situation
And this is what he said

He told me, “Famine, famine, famine
Famine on the land
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high”

It's really so high, high, high
Sky high
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high

So I went down to Old Harbour
To look for my brother John
To ask him how is life
And things and things and things

Oh, we started to have a little talk
About everything
About the situation
And this is what he said

He told me, “Famine, famine, famine
Famine's on the land
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high”

It's really so high, high, high
Sky high
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high

So I went down to Clarendon
To look for my family
To a little street called Treadlight
Is where I was born

Oh, and we started to have a little talk
Together, together
About the situation
And this is what they said

They told me, “Famine, famine, famine
Famine on the land
Because the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high”

It's really so high, high, high
Sky high
'Cause the cost of living
Is getting so high, high, high
