There was a time, where all felt fine
I came so close, to my personal cloud nine
Then right back down, I was earth-bound
Then right back up, this is what I found
I found Heaven-in those eyes,
What I saw-made me rise
Rise to the stars, where love was all it was
Rise to the stars, love was all it was, all it was

My eyes are shut but I still see
What is happening to me?
The beholder holds the key
Lock me up or set me free
My eyes are shut but still I see
What is happening to me?
The beholder holds the key
Lock me up or set me free

For once I might be right,
Change my ways over night
Realize what`s right or wrong,
This life will write my song, on and on
This is what it will become, my inspiration for so long
'til the night sets free to dawn so long, so long, so long

My eyes are shut but I still see
What is happening to me?
The beholder holds the key
Lock me up or set me free
My eyes are shut but still I see
What is happening to me?
The beholder holds the key
Lock me up or set me free

Some things may come and go
Disturbing this endless flow
And I see what`s at show
I see so much more than I could know
What`s making this happen to me?
I must examine it all to see
Cause what`s happening is endlessly
Is endlessly

My eyes are shut but I still see
What is happening to me?
The beholder holds the key
Lock me up or set me free
My eyes are shut but still I see
What is happening to me?
The beholder holds the key
Lock me up or set me free
