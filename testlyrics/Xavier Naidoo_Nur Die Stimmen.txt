Sometimes I feel 
Like a motherless child 
Sometimes I feel 
Like a motherless child 
A long way from home 
A long way from home 

Joshua fought the battle of jericho 
Jericho, jericho 
Joshua fought the battle of jericho 
And the walls come tumblin' down 

You may talk about your kings of gideon 
You may talk about your men of saul 
But there's none like good old joshua 
At the battle of jericho 

Amen, amen 
Amen, amen, amen 
Amen, amen 
Amen, amen, amen 
Amen, hallejulia 
Amen, hallejulia 
Amen, amen, amen
