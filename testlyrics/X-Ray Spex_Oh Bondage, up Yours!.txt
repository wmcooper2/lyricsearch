Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard
But I think "oh bondage, up yours!"
One-two-three-four!

Bind me, tie me, chain me to the wall
I wanna be a slave to you all

Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more
Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more

Chain-store chainsmoke, I consume you all
Chain-gang chainmail, I don't think at all

Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more
Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more

Thrash, me crush me, beat me till I fall
I wanna be a victim for you all

Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more
Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more

Bind me, tie me, chain me to the wall
I wanna be a slave to you all

Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more
Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more

Bind me, tie me, chain me to the wall
I wanna be a slave to you all

Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more
Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more

Oh bondage, up yours
Oh bondage, no more!
