If you'd like to make a call,
Please hang up and try again.
If you need help,
Hang up and then dial your operator.

Live from College Park,
Still kickin' it you know,
Another year another hit,
Shit, nigga you can't fade this.

[Kandi:]
If the music makes you move,
And you can fell the groove,
Then groove on, groove on.
If you feel like you want to make love,
Under the stars above,
Then love on, love on.
If there's something you want to say,
'Cause talking is the only way,
Then rap on, rap on.
'Cause whatever you do,
Oh, you gotta do your thang.
