Wanna dance, wanna dance?
Wanna move, wanna groove?
Wanna dance, wanna dance?
Wanna move, wanna groove?

Don't worry, I'll be back
And before the night is over
I will be with you again
And we'll be dancing together
Be it sunshine, be it rain
Ooh, I don't need nothing
If I can be with you
Cuz your good loving
It really sets me through
Yes, it does

I think we can make it
For the first time in my life
I think we can
Nobody but us can take it
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night

I think we can make it
For the first time in my life
I think we can
Nobody but us can take it
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night

Baby, baby
You gotta be positive about this
Yes, I know it's crazy, crazy
And there's a lot more on top of this
Just one more time, and then we'll leave
In and out, just like this
One more time, then we're up
That's what this is all about

I think we can make it
For the first time in my life
I think we can
Nobody but us can take it
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night

I think we can make it
For the first time in my life
I think we can
Nobody but us can take it
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night

You are exactly what I need
Very special, V.S.O.P.
And I'm so happy that I got
A chance to rock with you, non-stop

I think we can make it
For the first time in my life
I think we can
Nobody but us can take it
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night

I think we can make it
For the first time in my life
I think we can
Nobody but us can take it
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night
