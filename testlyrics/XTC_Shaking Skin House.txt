Zap, pow pow zap
Zap, pap, pap, pap zap
Da da da da
Zap, pap pap zap
Pop, pop pop pop

There's something coming
Maybe a song or two
Can't stop from strumming
Can you feel it too?

I'm merely a man and I want
Nothing but love from you
I'm merely a man and I want
Nothing more than to do
What I want in the souls
Of the order

Love [in a write up]
[from an anything] daughter

It's another another [prodder]
From shaking skin house
[another podder]
