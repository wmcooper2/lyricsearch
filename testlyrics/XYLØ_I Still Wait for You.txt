Sometimes I feel like I can't remember
Waking up with you when we were together
I lost my temper, you left at midnight
We saw the tears fall like rain on the headlights

It was always you and me
How could we be nothing, nothing?
I know that we don't speak
But if I could ask you one thing, one thing

Why can't we fucking get along?
Forget everything we did wrong
'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you
No, I don't want this to be true
This beautiful disaster is you
'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you

(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
I still wait for you

Lately I can't sleep, I flip the pillow
Tossing and turning and checking my cellphone
My head is a mess and so is my bedroom
I write a text then delete it, "I love you"

It was always you and me
How could we be nothing, nothing?
I know that we don't speak
But if I could ask you one thing, one thing

Why can't we fucking get along?
Forget everything we did wrong
'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you
No, I don't want this to be true
This beautiful disaster is you
'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you

(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
I still wait for you

Every second feels like forever
Where the fuck you been? Are you listening?
Don't know what you've got until it's gone and
Baby, all I need is you to tell me

Why can't we fucking get along? (I still wait for you)
Forget everything we did wrong (I still wait for you)
'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you
No, I don't want this to be true (I still wait for you)
This beautiful disaster is you (I still wait for you)
'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you

(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you
(But everyday, I still wait) I still wait for you

'Cause you've been the one
You know this will never change
But everyday, I still wait for you
