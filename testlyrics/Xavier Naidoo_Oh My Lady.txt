It was cold. But she was lovely.
I was told that she would never love me.
But still I hoped the love I felt it could be trusted.
So my case soon came to justice.
I found out they had taken my rights long ago and what they gave in return wasn´t nearly so.
But how could I´ve known, never was I shown little had I grown inside I was torn.
But her life´s my concern, I long have ignored the fact that I love you but I can´t anymore.

Oh my lady, gone for a year, she told me maybe  once she could stay here with me, oh she´s alive in my heart, in my mind, in my soul, there´s a glow in my heart, in my mind, in my soul. 
There´s a glow, there´s a glow, there´s a glow, there´s a glow - there´s a glow.

Where my lady are you now. 
A love so sacred still not allowed - life is hard. 
Sometimes life can be dreadful and this life I guess it´s more than a handful. 
In this war, we can not use weapons. 
And in this war we can only learn lessons. 
They had taken unripe fruits from the tree and I learned my lesson when the gave them to me, more could I see, clouds under me. 
I saw wars upon land I saw wars on the sea - oh

Oh my lady, gone for a year, she told me maybe once she could stay here with me, oh she´s alive in my heart, in my mind, in my soul, there´s a glow in my heart in my mind, in my soul. 
There´s a glow, there´s a glow, there´s a glow, there´s a glow - there´s a glow.
