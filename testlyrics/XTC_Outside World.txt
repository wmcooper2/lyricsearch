She has six swans singing in her sauna 
So she can't hear what's going on 
She can't hear what's going on 
In the outside world 
In the outside world 
In the outside 

Bad black and white men 
Standing in their pigpen 
Selling guns to simpletons 
To shoot 'em in the abdomen 
But she's not interested in that 
But she's not interested in that 
She has six swans singing in her sauna 
Ooo, outside, world, outside 

She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside 
So she can't hear what's going on 
She can't hear what's going on 
In the outside world 
In the outside world 
In the outside 

Bad brown and yellow men 
Splitting on their fellow men 
Drape her in a newspaper 
And stab her with a poison pen 
And she's not interested in that 
And she's not interested in that 
She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside 
Ooo, outside, world, outside 

You can keep your animals 
All the noise and the din 
Just make a little space for me 
I'm coming in

She has six swans singing in her sauna 
So she can't hear what's going on 
She can't hear what's going on 
She can't hear what's going on 
She won't hear what's going on 

What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
Whata whata whata whata whata whata whata
The outside world 
The outside world 
The outside world
