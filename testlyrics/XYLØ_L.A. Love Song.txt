Ice cold, heart is like a cool box
So grab another lite beer, baby
Inhale, breathing's getting harder
OD on you again

Late night, sun is getting higher
Red, white, I'm feelin' blue, baby
Bloodshot, head's a little lighter
OD on you again

We're all livin' in the gutter
Some of us are lookin' at the stars
Live fast, leave a pretty body
Lay it next to me

I wanna know, I wanna know
If this life will be the death of me, baby
Know, I gotta know, is this love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
If this life will be the death of me, baby
Know, I gotta know, is this love?

Tongue-tied, speakin' so softly
Come a little closer to me
Late night in the back of the taxi
I think that I love you

Nothing like the sun in California
It burns through the skin and
Deep breath, you know I tried to warn you
OD on me again

We're all looking at the gutter
But some of us are livin' with the stars
Live fast, leave a pretty body
I'll lay it next to you

I wanna know, I wanna know
If this life will be the death of me, baby
Know, I gotta know, is this love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
If this life will be the death of me, baby
Know, I gotta know, is this love?
Is this love?

Are you alive or are you just livin'?
'Cause some of us are lookin' at the stars
Are you alive or are you just livin'?
Layin' next to me

I wanna know, I wanna know
If this life will be the death of me, baby
Know, I gotta know, is this love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
If this life will be the death of me, baby
Know, I gotta know, is this love? (is this love?)
Is this love?
Is this love?
