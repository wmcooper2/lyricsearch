Everyday lead to late nights
Bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite
Homie, pass me a light, I got that master kush
Gave birth to you, bastards, told your momma the bush
Now here you are, I see you're feeling strong
My prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long
Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate
I wait my banner a piece, won't you take the paper
Pussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face
Hit you with the cage, back in place
Rip another page off the book of life
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

[Chorus]
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
I'm going forever be me, never, I'm forever a GE
All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
Smoking this weed, smoking is good
But I got what you need
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I made
Won't you change, I want you stay the same
But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
I'm going forever be me, never, I'm forever a G

It's getting hard to survive the streets that eat you alive
Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies
Too much rats are trapped inside of your rapping
Niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action
Do you, do you?
Whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
Because when I bring it to the whole court
Putting up a play of stats
While you're hanging with the roaches and rats
We're way above that
Now how you're loving that?
Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
I can't breathe, can't make it your bitch
Can't believe how deep in your shit
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

[Chorus]

The greatest trip that devil ever put together
Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
I see the down could crawl, quickly spreading like gun infection
And miss it after live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through
Shoul've been a screen play when I get to
More niggas away, IET, quit playing games in the middle of the street
Fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?
We don't play the games, just play for keeps and now
Back for the forth fly, back to the back who was back with a tour bus
Get it round the world for a few months
Down dead, way niggas gotta dumb trunk
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

[Chorus]
