Wait till your boat goes down
That's when you'll need me most
Wait till your boat goes down
And you're washed up on some foreign and unfamiliar coast 

Yachting's fine
Sailing round and round in social circles
In a sea of diamonds and wine
Wait till you need a shoulder
A girl's best friend's not any consolation
When you're that much older

Wait till your boat goes down
That's when you'll need me most
Wait till your boat goes down
And you're washed up on some foreign and unfamiliar coast 

Skiing's grand
Drawing classic lines around the millionaires
And money men from Switzerland
Wait till you need a shoulder
A girl's fox furs won't warm your heart
When you're that much older

Wait till your boat goes down
That's when you'll need me most
Wait till your boat goes down
And you're washed up on some foreign and unfamiliar coast 

And if you're late and man he sees you when you're young and looking good
Watch the big fish swim right out to take the bait you offered like you
Knew they would
Too much caviar only points to middle aged spread
There won't be room for many playboys in your single bed

Wait till your boat goes down
That's when you'll need me most
Wait till your boat goes down
And you're washed up on some foreign and unfamiliar coast 

Wait till your boat goes down
That's when you'll need me most
Wait till your boat goes down
And you're washed up
