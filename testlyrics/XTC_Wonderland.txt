Can't you see 
Love and affection 
When it's put 
In you direction 
Wrapped in your mysterious wonderland 

No fast car 
Can make you grow up 
Gentlemen 
You think you've sewn up 
Locked in your wonderful wonderland 

No dark horse like me can cramp all of your style 
Too plain and simple I am for your file 
One day you will break out of your spell 
And some day you will want me for your own 
And I'll say welcome to reality 

All this talk 
Of late night parties 
Flirting with the lower gentry 
Lost in your magical wonderland 

Out of depth 
Out of class 
Phase of your life 
Will come to pass 
Caught in this tragic wonderland 

All of the riches that shine will turn sour 
Each moment you slip you will bring near the hour 
And one day you will break out of your spell 
And some day you will want me for your own 
And I'll say welcome to reality 

Wrapped in your mysterious wonderland 

Caught in your superficial 
Nonexistent 
Fairy story 
Wonderland

Caught in your tragic wonderland 
Wonderland
