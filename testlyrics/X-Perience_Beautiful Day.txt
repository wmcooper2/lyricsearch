Its years since you've been leaving
The places we were born
I wake up I am receiving
A sign of your return
You gave me one good reason
To wait until you come
I'm waiting and I'm dreaming
We're drowning in the sun
A beautiful day and a beautiful night
You drive me crazy when you hold me tight
I live my life so slow and
I'll walk while you will run
I slam the door behind me
The same way as you've done
The flowers you've planted
Are growing in the light
They're waiting in the backyard
I visit every night
