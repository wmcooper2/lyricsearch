Say! Have you ever met the girl
Who's the toast of the town?
A work of art without a question
You'd better write her number down
Oh! the lady in red, the fellows are crazy
For the lady in red
She's a bit gaudy, but laudy
What a personality
Oh! the lady in red, is fresh as a daisy
When the town is in bed
Dancing and dining and shining
With originally
She is very proper
She's nothing more than a pal
But oh me! and oh my! you'd never stop her
She'd be a dangerous gal
If she should ever meet the right guy
Oh! the lady in red, the fellows are crazy
For the lady in red
Is she a study, oh! buddy
What a personality
She's got vitality
