(Ohhhh, yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus:]
You can turn your back and then walk away
(You can turn your back and then walk away)
Soon be comin the judgment day
(Ahh, soon there be comin the judgment day)

[Xzibit]
Yes, uhh, breathe with me
C'mon.. listen, yo
I know you're fed up, feel like you can't get up
Have faith, stay strong, keep your head up
Yo, it only gets worse; we in a world
Where your status and your bank account determine your worth
There's no time to rehearse, the clock been tickin
Cause we all started dyin at birth, I speak the truth and it hurts
It felt like I was dyin of thirst
'Til I was blessed with my voice, I move mountains with verse
The worst thing you ever seen in your life, "The Passion of Christ"
Pregnant chicks buyin rock, hittin the pipe
It ain't like I ain't tried to tell ya; misery love company
Keepin the wrong company brings failure
Cause people use people like paraphernalia
With a scam, with a scheme, with a dream to sell ya
But I ain't got nothin but love for all my soldiers and thugs
To all of my women, we gotta keep livin, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Yeah! c'mon
Mr. X to the Z had to raise the stakes
Had to touch my people like T.D. Jakes
On the ground like a nigga flippin crumbs to cake
I won't stop like an eighteen wheeler with no brakes
Bein dipped in her-on so each CD's weight
Niggaz be fake, they speak what they can't create (create)
You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame
One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff
I was only fifteen, tryin to pass that rock
Never got caught, just sat down, collected my thoughts
This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat
I'm just another nigga sellin some coke, y'know?
Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote
My callin for ballin wasn't peddling dope
It was oversea convoys, bangin out cuts
No police or government agency lockin me up, so what?

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
C'mon..
What do you believe in? I believe in karma
And that fo'-five to drop that drama
Can't wait for the time when I meet my maker
Picture everlasting life in Jamaica, time to wake up
Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words
Your words become actions when the bullshit happens
Keep laughin, that's when the gauge start clackin
Feel the buckshots smackin have your body mismatchin
Yo, I feel the devil tryin to force my hand
Steady bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man
See I was born to be all that I can, without a Uncle named Sam
As you can see we just a part of his plan
'Cause first there was a war on blacks
And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in Iraq, c'mon
I never give up, I only give back
I ain't preachin I'm just statin the facts
So let the choir sing!

[Chorus]
