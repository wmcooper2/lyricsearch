WOULD YOU COME AND LOOK AROUND
SEE THE MOTION AND CIRCLE ROUND
FEEL IT WHIRL THROUGH THE FIELDS

ALL THE YEARS WE WANDERED ABOUT
AND LET OUR YOUTH STRIP US OUT
NOW LOCK UP THE DOOR TO INDIGNATION

AS ALL APPEARS TO RECOVER
(WOULD YOU COME-LOOK AROUND-SEE THE MOTION-CIRCLE ROUND)
ALL APPEARS TO RECOVER
(ALL THE YEARS WE WANDERED ABOUT-LET OUR YOUTH-STRIP US OUT-COME WITH ME)

HERE WE ARE IN WONDER LEFT WITH ALL LEFT TO DISCOVER
WILL YOU STAY WATCH BY ME

AS ALL APPEARS TO RECOVER
(WOULD YOU COME-LOOK AROUND-SEE THE MOTION-CIRCLE ROUND)
ALL APPEARS TO RECOVER
(ALL THE YEARS WE WANDERED ABOUT-LET OUR YOUTH-STRIP US OUT-COME WITH ME-BREAK OUT)
AS ALL APPEARS TO RECOVER
(WOULD YOU COME-LOOK AROUND-SEE THE MOTION-CIRCLE ROUND)
ALL APPEARS TO RECOVER
(ALL THE YEARS WE WANDERED ABOUT-LET OUR YOUTH-STRIP US OUT-COME WITH ME-BREAK OUT)
ALL APPEARS TO DISCOVER
(SEE THE MOTION-CIRCLE ROUND-COME WITH ME-BREAK OUT
