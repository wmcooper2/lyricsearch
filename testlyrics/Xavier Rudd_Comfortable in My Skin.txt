Comfortable in my skin it's all for one and one for all this year
Tell me cause I wonder will you take my hand walk with me to the promise land
We can sing one song
No suffering at all

Comfortable in my skin I wonder now will she let me in
Been rolling with the sound of the silent hawk
Pinch my nerve as I stumble forth can we all sing one song
No suffering at all

Do you feel like any of this is wrong
Do any of you feel like any of this is wrong
Coz I feel like some of this is wrong

Comfortable in my skin I wonder now will she let me in
Been rolling with the sound of the silent hawk
Pinch my nerve as I stumble forth can we all sing one song
No suffering at all

Can we all sing one song no suffering at all
No suffering at all
