Everything’s changed, everything’s changed
Pouring out liquor in the pouring rain
Let it go cold
Silent stage
Everything’s changed, everything’s changed

All my people in the same old bars
All my people with the same old scars
But everything’s changed, everything’s changed
Say what you, say what you will

I’ve been living in the dark for a long, long time
But I see better at night

Baby, ‘cause you, you are my shining star
Because you, you are my shining
You are my shining star
And I’ll hold you closer if you go supernova
You will be, you will be
Forever my shining, ever my shining star
Forever my shining, ever my shining star

Everything’s changed, everything’s changed
Your money don’t talk
But the money don’t rain
Everything’s changed, everything’s changed
The same old lovers with the same old games

I’ve been living in the dark for a long, long time
But I sleep better at night

Knowing that you, you are my shining star
‘Cause you, you are my shining
You are my shining star
And I’ll hold you closer if you go supernova
You will be, you will be
Forever my shining, ever my shining star
Ever my shining, ever my shining star

See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer care
See, I no longer

Knowing that you, you are my shining star
‘Cause you, you are my shining
You are my shining star
And I’ll hold you closer if you go supernova
You will be, you will be
Forever my shining, ever my shining star
Ever my shining, ever my shining star
Ever my shining, ever my shining star
