Oh heli, oh heli 
I'm crouching here with a telescope in hand 
Looking across our lego land 
I really think it's about time that she came down 

She a laughing giggly whirlybird 
She got to be obscene to be obheard 
I really think its about time that she came down 

And I object to all the air male that she pick up 
The air male that she pick up 
The air male that she pick up, oh oh oh

When she's up there twirling round 
Just like a helicopter, copter 
She's landing on the town 
It's about time that I stopped her, stopped her 
When she's up there twirling round, round, round 
Just like a helicopter, copter 
Oh heli, oh heli 

Now she's away from convent she's gone wild 
She's grown from a nice young lady to a child 
I really think its about time that she came down 

She a laughing giggly whirlybird 
She got to be obscene to be obheard 
I really think it's about time that she came down

And I object to all the air male that she pick up 
The air male that she pick up 
The air male that she pick up, oh oh oh

When she's up there twirling round 
Just like a helicopter, copter 
She's landing on the town 
It's about time that I stop her, stop her 
When she's up there twirling round, round, round 
Just like a helicopter, copter 
Oh heli, oh heli 

Oh heli, oh heli 

When she's up there twirling round 
Just like a helicopter, copter 
She's landing on the town 
It's about time that I stop her, stop her 
When she's up there twirling round, round, round 
Just like a helicopter, copter 
Oh heli, oh heli, oh heli, awh

When she's up there twirling round, round, round, round, round, round
Like a helicopter, copter 
She's landing on the town, look out town 
It's about time that I stop her, stop her 
When she's up there floating round, round, round 
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round, round, round, r, r, r, r, r
Oh heli, oh heli
