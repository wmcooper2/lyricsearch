[Chorus]
Sometimes it all just come together, you know?
I put my city on my back, now
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided trough the struggle, we fall
Got my city on a map, now
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all
You gotta stand tall

To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates
Burn the back wood, burn it back to your fingertips
Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment
You couldn’t have told me none of this back in ’96
The ability to crawl upon the bottom, this bitch
This is our time I’m spending mine up in this bitch
I still remember the very moment I was enlisted
I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business
And when there’s blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters
They wanna debate on television about the victim
Right or wrong, Treyfa was my little man
I would take a chainsaw to z...? my man

[Chorus]

For all the moments I wasted on making others happy
Attack me, I’m bulletproof, tag me, I’ve seen the virus through
I never lied to you, still rolling with golden views
Spend every word and I mean it, mean it and I really buy to you
'Cause I'd rather be in hell than a jail cell
I’m hancock, superheroes lend me cocktails
I never feel, don’t try to patronize me
I learn, I’m painfully aware of everything in my surroundings
I am shaved, fully shining, never touched the silver lightning
The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds
I hear my city calling, here come the jogging
Now are twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot

[Chorus]

So, failure ain't an option
How do you think I made it out that corner apartment?
Turn my corner to my market, and now I target the same niggas
That taught on all that dumb shit
Because when the gun clicking
That bullet leaving can’t get that life back
Karma is a bitch and believe me, she’ll get it right back
They say that success is the best revenge
But who really wins if we all die in the end
If I had it all, then I probably wouldn’t pray the same
And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain
My name good in every corner in my city
You don’t believe me, then come fuck with me

[Chorus]
